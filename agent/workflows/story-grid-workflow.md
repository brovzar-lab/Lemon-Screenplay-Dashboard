# Story Grid-First Workflow

This workflow implements Shawn Coyne's Story Grid methodology by establishing structural foundation **before** generating content.

---

## 🎯 Why This Order Matters

**Traditional Flow (Wrong):**
```
Idea → Synopsis → Analyze Structure (too late!)
```

**Story Grid-First Flow (Correct):**
```
Idea → Define Structure → Generate Synopsis (aligned with genre conventions)
```

**Key Principle:** "Know your genre FIRST, then build your story"

## 📋 The Workflow

### **Stage 1: Foundation (3 Steps)**

#### Step 1: Brain Dump
- Free-form ideation
- Upload screenplay, paste URL, or type/record your pitch
- No structure required yet

#### Step 2: Concept & Logline
- Define title, genre, target audience
- Craft your one-sentence pitch
- Refine logline using AI analysis

#### Step 3: Story Grid Foundation ⭐ **NEW**
- **Five-Leaf Clover Genres:**
  - Time (Arc, Flat)
  - Reality (Realism, Fantasy)
  - Style (Serious, Satire, Ironic)
  - External Content (Action, Horror, Love, etc.)
  - Structure (Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot)
  - Internal Content (Worldview, Morality, Status)

- **Objects of Desire:**
  - Conscious (A-Story): What the protagonist wants
  - Subconscious (B-Story): What they actually need

- **Core Story Elements:**
  - Core Value (Life/Death, Love/Hate, etc.)
  - Value Progression (positive → negative or vice versa)
  - Controlling Idea (thematic statement)

- **Global Structure (25/50/25):**
  - Beginning Hook (Act 1)
  - Middle Build (Act 2)
  - Ending Payoff (Act 3)

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use the **AI Analysis** button for quick completion. The Genre Guide provides reference for obligatory scenes and conventions.

## 🎓 Understanding Story Grid Elements

### Five-Leaf Clover
Not just "genre" - it's 6 dimensions:
- **Time:** Does character change (Arc) or stay the same (Flat)?
- **Reality:** Realistic or fantastical world?
- **Style:** Serious, satirical, or ironic tone?
- **External Content:** The "marketing genre" (Action, Thriller, Love, etc.)
- **Structure:** Archplot (classic), Miniplot (art house), or Antiplot (experimental)?
- **Internal Content:** Character's internal journey (Worldview, Morality, Status)

### Objects of Desire
- **Conscious (A-Story):** External goal driving the plot
  - Example: "Stop the killer" in a Thriller
- **Subconscious (B-Story):** Internal need driving character arc
  - Example: "Find redemption" in the same Thriller

**Best stories:** A-Story and B-Story collide at Crisis

### Value Progression
The emotional journey on your genre's spectrum:
- **Thriller:** Life → Unconsciousness → Death → Damnation
- **Love:** Hate → Indifference → Like → Love
- **Action:** Weakness → Strength → Power

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I skip Story Grid?**
A: Yes, but your synopsis will be generic. Story Grid is the difference between a "plot summary" and a "genre-mastered professional pitch."

**Q: How long does AI Analysis take?**
A: 2-3 minutes. The AI analyzes your logline and suggests Story Grid elements.

**Q: Can I change Story Grid elements later?**
A: Yes! Return to Stage 1, Step 3 anytime. Just regenerate your synopsis afterward.

**Q: What if I don't know my genre?**
A: Use the **Genre Guide** button. It explains each genre's conventions, obligatory scenes, and value spectrum.

**Q: Do I need all 6 genres in the Five-Leaf Clover?**
A: Minimum: External Content Genre. More complete = better AI synopsis.

## 🎬 What Success Looks Like

**Before Story Grid:**
> "A detective hunts a serial killer while dealing with personal issues."

**After Story Grid:**
> "In this **Thriller** (Life → Damnation), a morally compromised detective (conscious: stop the killer, subconscious: redemption) descends from professional duty to personal corruption, forced to choose at Crisis: save the next victim or preserve his soul."

**See the difference?** Genre mastery, value progression, dual storylines, emotional stakes. That's Story Grid.
