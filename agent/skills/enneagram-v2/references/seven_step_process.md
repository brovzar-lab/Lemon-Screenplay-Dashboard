# Jeff Lyons' Seven-Step Rapid Story Development Process

Comprehensive guide to Jeff Lyons' methodology from *Rapid Story Development for Film & Television*.

## Overview

The Seven-Step Rapid Story Development Process bridges the gap between talent and craft, providing a repeatable methodology for creating compelling stories using the Enneagram. This process is designed for **film and television** development specifically.

## The Seven Steps

### Step 1: Build the Enneagram Foundation of the Moral Component

The **moral component** is the narrative crankshaft that drives the entire story. It's based on the protagonist's Enneagram style and consists of:

- **Core Fear**: What the protagonist is fundamentally afraid of
- **Core Desire**: What the protagonist fundamentally wants
- **Moral Problem**: The central ethical/philosophical question the story explores

**Process:**
1. Identify the moral problem your story addresses
2. Select the Enneagram type whose fear/desire naturally connects to this problem
3. Establish this as your protagonist's foundation

**Example**: A story about perfectionism vs. acceptance → Type 1 protagonist

### Step 2: Define the Protagonist's Enneagram Style

Go deep into your protagonist's core Enneagram type:

**Required Elements:**
- Basic fear and desire
- Healthy, average, and unhealthy behavior ranges
- Core motivations and decision-making patterns
- Emotional triggers and blind spots
- Communication style
- How they handle stress and security

**Key Concept**: Your protagonist should start in the **average to unhealthy** range of their type. Healthy protagonists have nowhere to grow.

### Step 3: Define Evolution and De-Evolution Enneagram Styles

Map your protagonist's character arc using the Enneagram's movement patterns:

#### Pattern of Decline (De-Evolution)
The protagonist moves toward their **stress point** (unhealthy behaviors of another type):

- Type 1 → Type 4 (critical to moody/withdrawn)
- Type 2 → Type 8 (helpful to aggressive/controlling)
- Type 3 → Type 9 (driven to apathetic/disengaged)
- Type 4 → Type 2 (unique to clingy/possessive)
- Type 5 → Type 7 (analytical to scattered/impulsive)
- Type 6 → Type 3 (loyal to competitive/arrogant)
- Type 7 → Type 1 (enthusiastic to critical/rigid)
- Type 8 → Type 5 (powerful to isolated/withdrawn)
- Type 9 → Type 6 (peaceful to anxious/defensive)

#### Pattern of Elevation (Evolution)
The protagonist moves toward their **integration point** (healthy behaviors of another type):

- Type 1 → Type 7 (principled to joyful/spontaneous)
- Type 2 → Type 4 (helpful to authentic/self-aware)
- Type 3 → Type 6 (successful to loyal/committed)
- Type 4 → Type 1 (unique to disciplined/objective)
- Type 5 → Type 8 (analytical to confident/decisive)
- Type 6 → Type 9 (anxious to relaxed/trusting)
- Type 7 → Type 5 (scattered to focused/profound)
- Type 8 → Type 2 (controlling to caring/protective)
- Type 9 → Type 3 (passive to assertive/engaged)

**Story Structure Application:**
- **Act 1**: Show baseline Enneagram behaviors
- **Act 2**: Pattern of Decline - protagonist devolves to stress point
- **Doom Moment**: Lowest point (emotional devastation + physical isolation)
- **Moment of Truth**: First hint protagonist is ready to change
- **Act 3**: Pattern of Elevation - protagonist integrates healthy behaviors
- **Climax**: Demonstrates fully integrated self

### Step 4: Identify Common and Uncommon Pinches, Crunches, Blind Spots, and Distortion Filters

The **Pinch-Crunch Model** is central to creating authentic conflict.

#### Pinches
"Conflict buttons" that trigger your protagonist when pushed:

**Common Pinches** (typical for each type):
- **Type 1**: Being criticized, mistakes, lack of fairness
- **Type 2**: Being unappreciated, feeling unloved, rejection
- **Type 3**: Failure, looking incompetent, being exposed as fake
- **Type 4**: Being ordinary, feeling misunderstood, abandonment
- **Type 5**: Incompetence, emotional demands, invasion of privacy
- **Type 6**: Lack of support, betrayal, uncertainty
- **Type 7**: Being trapped, boredom, emotional pain
- **Type 8**: Being controlled, showing vulnerability, weakness
- **Type 9**: Conflict, being overlooked, forced decisions

**Uncommon Pinches** (character-specific):
Add individual pinches unique to your character that still align with their core type.

#### Pinch Behaviors
How the character reacts when pinched:

- Curt statements
- Withdrawal
- Aggression
- Passive-aggressiveness
- Over-explaining
- Deflection
- Intimidation
- Nervous laughter
- Accusations related to other issues

#### The Crunch
After **approximately 3 pinches**, the character reaches a **crunch moment** - a larger breakdown or explosion where accumulated stress surfaces dramatically.

**Real-Life Statistic**: In human behavior, it typically takes three pinches to create a crunch. Use this as your guide.

**Example - Dolores Umbridge** (Type 1):
- Pinch #1: Harry talks over her, challenges authority → Curt statements, orders detention
- Pinch #2: McGonagall criticizes her methods → Intimidation, accusations
- Pinch #3: Weasley twins create chaos → Increased cruelty and punishment
- **Crunch**: Attempts illegal torture spell, loses control completely when deceived

#### Blind Spots
What the character cannot see about themselves due to their type:

- Type 1: Their own imperfection and rigidity
- Type 2: Their manipulation and neediness
- Type 3: Their inauthenticity and image obsession
- Type 4: Their self-absorption and rejection of the ordinary
- Type 5: Their emotional disconnection and hoarding
- Type 6: Their projection of fear and worst-case thinking
- Type 7: Their pain avoidance and commitment issues
- Type 8: Their impact on others and need for control
- Type 9: Their conflict avoidance and self-neglect

#### Distortion Filters
How each type distorts reality to maintain their worldview:

- Type 1: "There's a right way to do things"
- Type 2: "People need me"
- Type 3: "Image is everything"
- Type 4: "I'm fundamentally different"
- Type 5: "I need to conserve my resources"
- Type 6: "The world is dangerous"
- Type 7: "I must avoid pain"
- Type 8: "Only the strong survive"
- Type 9: "Conflict is bad"

### Step 5: Define the Opposition

The opposition should be designed to **directly challenge** the protagonist's Enneagram weaknesses.

**Opposition Types:**

1. **Antagonist as Different Enneagram Type**
   - Choose a type whose core fear/desire conflicts with protagonist's
   - Example: Type 1 protagonist vs. Type 7 antagonist (order vs. chaos)

2. **Antagonist as Same Type (Shadow Self)**
   - Shows protagonist what they could become if they don't change
   - Example: Healthy Type 3 vs. Unhealthy Type 3

3. **Antagonist Targeting Protagonist's Blind Spots**
   - Antagonist exploits what protagonist can't see about themselves
   - Most psychologically sophisticated approach

**Key Principle**: The opposition should **pinch the protagonist repeatedly**, driving them toward their crunch moments and eventually the doom moment.

### Step 6: Build the Enneagram Elements of the Story Middle

The middle of your story is where the **Pattern of Decline** operates.

**Structure:**
1. **Inciting Incident** → Disrupts protagonist's world
2. **Series of Pinches** → Protagonist encounters increasingly challenging obstacles
3. **Progressive Crunches** → Protagonist breaks down repeatedly
4. **Devolution Visible** → Protagonist clearly moving toward stress point behaviors
5. **Doom Moment** → Rock bottom (emotional devastation + physical isolation)

**Critical Elements:**

- **3-5 major pinch sequences** leading to crunches
- **Clear devolution arc** showing protagonist adopting stress point behaviors
- **Blind spots exploited** by opposition
- **Distortion filters** causing poor decisions
- **Allies/helpers** attempt to intervene but fail until protagonist ready to change

**Example Structure:**
- Pinch sequence #1 → Small crunch → Slightly worse behavior
- Pinch sequence #2 → Medium crunch → Noticeably worse behavior
- Pinch sequence #3 → Major crunch → Clear stress point behaviors
- Final pinches → DOOM MOMENT → Complete breakdown

---

### Step 7: Develop the Premise Line

Synthesize everything into a **premise line** that encapsulates your story:

**Formula:**
[Protagonist] must [external goal] in order to [internal need], but [opposition/obstacle] stands in the way, forcing them to [moral choice].

**Example**:
*A perfectionist teacher (Type 1) must inspire her rebellious students to pass their exams in order to prove her methods work, but a free-spirited new principal (Type 7) threatens to dismantle her structured curriculum, forcing her to choose between rigid control and trusting her students' creativity.*

**Premise Line Must Include:**
- Protagonist's Enneagram type (explicit or implicit)
- External dramatic goal
- Internal emotional need (connected to core fear/desire)
- Clear opposition
- Moral dimension that requires growth

## Key Concepts from Jeff Lyons

### The Narrative Crankshaft

The Enneagram provides the **narrative crankshaft** - the core mechanism that drives personality and therefore drives the story. Unlike archetypes (which are patterns FOR behavior), the Enneagram IS the realized behavior itself.

**Analogy**: Archetype = quilt pattern; Enneagram = actual quilt

### The Moral Component

Stories are fundamentally about **moral problems**. The Enneagram connects directly to these problems because each type embodies a specific moral struggle:

- Type 1: Perfectionism vs. Acceptance
- Type 2: Selflessness vs. Self-care
- Type 3: Achievement vs. Authenticity
- Type 4: Uniqueness vs. Belonging
- Type 5: Knowledge vs. Connection
- Type 6: Security vs. Trust
- Type 7: Freedom vs. Commitment
- Type 8: Power vs. Vulnerability
- Type 9: Peace vs. Assertion

### Story vs. Writing

**Story** = Development function (what happens, why it matters)  
**Writing** = Expression function (how it's conveyed)

Most writers are good at writing but weak at **story development**. The Enneagram-Story Connection strengthens the development function.

### Supporting Characters from Wings

Use the **wings** of your protagonist's type to build supporting characters:

**Process:**
1. Identify protagonist's core type
2. Use the two adjacent types (wings) as supporting character bases
3. Develop each wing character independently but ensure they **support the protagonist's journey**

**Example**: Type 4 protagonist
- Wing 3 character: Achievement-focused friend who challenges protagonist's isolation
- Wing 5 character: Intellectual mentor who enables protagonist's withdrawal

**Critical**: Supporting characters must **serve the protagonist's story**, not exist independently. They should represent aspects of the protagonist's psyche externalized.

## Integration with Story Structure

### Classic Three-Act Structure

**ACT 1 - Setup (Pattern Establishment)**
- Introduce protagonist in average/unhealthy range
- Establish normal world and Enneagram baseline
- Inciting incident pinches protagonist
- Show core fear and desire in action

**ACT 2A - Confrontation (Pattern of Decline)**
- Escalating pinches
- First crunch
- Protagonist adopts unhealthy coping mechanisms
- Midpoint: Major crunch, acceleration toward doom

**ACT 2B - Deepening Crisis (Continued Decline)**
- Protagonist exhibits stress point behaviors clearly
- Blind spots fully exploited
- Supporting characters fail to help
- Doom moment: Emotional devastation + Physical isolation

**ACT 3 - Resolution (Pattern of Elevation)**
- Moment of Truth: Glimpse of change possibility
- Protagonist begins integration
- Climax: Demonstrates integrated healthy behaviors
- Resolution: New self established

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with healthy protagonist**: No arc possible
2. **Skipping the doom moment**: Undercuts transformation weight
3. **Too few pinches**: Pattern doesn't establish
4. **Generic opposition**: Must target Enneagram weaknesses
5. **Supporting characters as independent stories**: They must serve protagonist
6. **Vague moral component**: Must be specific to Enneagram type
7. **Ignored blind spots**: These create the richest dramatic irony
