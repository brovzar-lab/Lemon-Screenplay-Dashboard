# Enneagram V2: Character Development for Film & Television

Expert system for creating compelling, authentic characters using the Enneagram personality framework, based on Jeff Lyons' *Rapid Story Development* methodology.

## Core Principles

### The Enneagram Framework

The Enneagram identifies nine distinct personality types, each with unique motivations, fears, desires, and behavioral patterns. In storytelling, these types provide a robust foundation for multidimensional characters that feel authentic and compelling.

### Character Evolution and Devolution

Characters move along their type's development spectrum based on dramatic pressures:

- **Evolution (Integration)**: Movement toward health and personal growth
- **Devolution (Disintegration)**: Movement toward stress and dysfunction

This dynamic creates organic character arcs driven by story conflict.

## The Nine Enneagram Types

### Type 1 - The Perfectionist
- **Core Desire**: To be right and improve the world
- **Core Fear**: Being corrupt, defective, or wrong
- **Stress Point**: Moves to unhealthy Type 4 (moody, withdrawn)
- **Integration Point**: Moves to healthy Type 7 (spontaneous, joyful)
- **Key Traits**: Principled, purposeful, self-controlled, critical

### Type 2 - The Helper
- **Core Desire**: To be loved and appreciated

## Jeff Lyons' Seven-Step Rapid Story Development Process

For **detailed methodology** on using the Enneagram for story development, see [seven_step_process.md](references/seven_step_process.md).

**Quick Overview:**

1. **Build the Moral Foundation** - Identify the moral problem and protagonist's Enneagram type
2. **Define Protagonist's Style** - Deep dive into core type behaviors, fears, desires
3. **Map Evolution/De-Evolution** - Chart stress points (decline) and integration points (growth)
4. **Identify Pinches, Crunches, Blind Spots** - Design conflict using "pinch-crunch" model
5. **Define Opposition** - Create antagonist that targets protagonist's Enneagram weaknesses
6. **Build Story Middle** - Structure Act 2 using Pattern of Decline leading to Doom Moment
7. **Develop Premise Line** - Synthesize everything into a compelling story premise

**Key Concepts:**
- **Pinch-Crunch Model**: ~3 "pinches" (conflict buttons) lead to 1 "crunch" (breakdown)
- **Pattern of Decline**: Act 2 shows protagonist devolving to stress point behaviors
- **Pattern of Elevation**: Act 3 shows protagonist integrating healthy behaviors
- **Doom Moment**: Emotional devastation + physical isolation before transformation
- **Narrative Crankshaft**: Enneagram provides the core driver of personality and story

## Building Enneagram-Based Story Teams

### Team Composition Principles

**Complementary Dynamics**: Select team members whose Enneagram types create productive tension and balance. Example: Type 1 (Perfectionist) + Type 7 (Enthusiast) creates natural conflict between structure and spontaneity.

**Enneagram Triads for Balance**:
- **Head types (5, 6, 7)**: Think through problems, analyze
- **Heart types (2, 3, 4)**: Feel through problems, relate emotionally
- **Body types (8, 9, 1)**: Act through problems, assert physically

Balanced teams include perspectives from all three triads.

### Character Arc Integration with Team Stages

Map individual character evolution/devolution to team development stages:

**Forming Stage**: 
- Introduce characters at baseline Enneagram expression
- Show core motivations and fears as team orientates
- Establish initial dynamics and tensions

**Storming Stage**:
- Push characters toward devolution (stress points)
- Type 1s become more critical and rigid
- Type 2s become manipulative and possessive
- Type 8s become domineering and confrontational
- Conflicts emerge from incompatible fears and desires

**Norming Stage**:
- Characters begin evolution journey
- Working agreements form
- Characters integrate healthier aspects of their type
- Movement toward integration points begins

**Performing Stage**:
- Characters reach highest function
- Demonstrate integrated, healthy expression
- Team achieves synergy through individual growth

## Advanced Techniques

### Wing Integration

Each type has two adjacent types (wings) that add nuance:
- Type 1 can be 1w9 (more idealistic) or 1w2 (more people-focused)
- Wings create variation within the same core type
- Use wings to differentiate multiple characters of the same type

### Subtype Variations

Three subtypes for each type create distinct expressions:
- **Self-Preservation**: Focus on safety, security, comfort
- **Social**: Focus on groups, belonging, recognition
- **Sexual/One-to-One**: Focus on intensity, connection, intimacy

Example: A self-preservation Type 4 hoards beauty/objects; a social Type 4 focuses on being unique in groups; a sexual Type 4 seeks intense emotional connections.

### Genre-Specific Team Composition

**Action/Thriller Teams**:
- Leaders: Type 8 (Challenger) or Type 3 (Achiever)
- Support: Type 6 (Loyalist) for strategy
- Wildcard: Type 7 (Enthusiast) for unpredictability

**Mystery/Detective Teams**:
- Lead: Type 5 (Investigator) or Type 1 (Perfectionist)
- Balance: Type 4 or Type 2 for emotional/intuitive perspective

**Ensemble Dramas**:
- Full spectrum of types for rich interpersonal dynamics
- Multiple perspective points on central conflict

## Character Development Worksheet

For each character, complete:

1. **Core Enneagram Type** and justification
2. **Wing Influence** and how it manifests
3. **Subtype** (self-preservation, social, or sexual)
4. **Core Fear** and **Core Desire**
5. **Baseline Behavior** at story start (healthy, average, or unhealthy)
6. **Stress Point** (devolution path under pressure)
7. **Integration Point** (evolution path when growing)
8. **Role in Team Dynamic** (complementary function)
9. **Character Arc** mapped to team stages
10. **Key Relationships** with other team members and Enneagram dynamics

## Practical Application Process

### Step 1: Identify Character's Core Type
- What drives this character fundamentally?
- What do they fear most?
- What patterns repeat in their behavior?

### Step 2: Determine Starting Health Level
- Healthy: Living their best self, integrated
- Average: Normal functioning with typical struggles
- Unhealthy: Dominated by fear, destructive patterns

### Step 3: Map the Arc
- Where does the story take them?
- Do they evolve (move to integration point)?
- Do they devolve (move to stress point)?
- What story events trigger these movements?

### Step 4: Build Team Dynamics
- How does this type interact with other types?
- What conflicts naturally emerge?
- What complementary strengths appear?
- How do team stages affect individual arcs?

## Common Pitfalls

- **Stereotyping**: Don't reduce characters to one-dimensional type expressions
- **Static Types**: Characters must move along their type's spectrum
- **Ignoring Context**: Same type behaves differently in different genres and situations
- **Overcomplicating**: Not every supporting character needs full Enneagram development
- **Forgetting Story**: Enneagram serves the story, not vice versa
- **Inconsistent Motivation**: Ensure character actions align with their type's core fear/desire

## Integration with Story Structure

### Act 1 - Setup
- Establish character at baseline Enneagram expression
- Show core fear and desire in action
- Introduce stressors that will test the character

### Act 2 - Confrontation
- Push character toward stress point (devolution)
- Show unhealthy expressions of type
- Create conflicts with other types
- Plant seeds of potential growth

### Act 3 - Resolution
- Character reaches crisis point
- Choice: continue devolution or begin evolution
- Movement toward integration point (positive arc)
- OR deeper descent into unhealthy type (negative arc)
