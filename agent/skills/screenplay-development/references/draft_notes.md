# Draft Notes: Actionable Feedback Examples

Comprehensive guide to giving specific, solution-oriented screenplay notes with before/after examples.

## The Anatomy of a Great Note

Every actionable note has three parts:

```
1. LOCATION: Page number, scene, character
2. PROBLEM: What's not working and why
3. SOLUTION: Specific fix with example if needed
```

## Scene-Level Notes

### Example 1: Cutting Redundancy

**BEFORE:**
```
Page 34-38: Four-page coffee shop scene where Emma tells Rachel about the breakup.
```

**NOTE:**
```
Page 34-38: Cut the entire coffee shop scene. It's redundant—we SAW the breakup on p.29-31, we don't need Emma explaining it. Jump straight from the breakup to Emma alone in her apartment (p.39), looking at couple photos. Show her pain through ACTION (tearing up photos, throwing his stuff in a box), not DIALOGUE.
```

### Example 2: Lacking Visual Storytelling

**BEFORE:**
```
Jake tells Sarah about his military background.
```

**NOTE:**
```
Page 23, lines 8-14: Cut Jake's monologue about his military past. Show it instead:
- His apartment: medals on wall, bed made with hospital corners, shoes lined perfectly
- How he reacts to Sarah's messiness: subtly straightening her purse when she sets it down crooked
- A moment where he checks corners before entering a room (combat instinct)
Audiences will KNOW he's military without a single word of exposition.
```

### Example 3: Weak Conflict

**BEFORE:**
```
SCENE 45: Office argument. Boss says "You're fired." Hero says "Fine." And leaves.
```

**NOTE:**
```
Page 45: The firing scene is too passive. Give the hero AGENCY:

CURRENT: Boss fires hero, hero accepts
BETTER: Hero stands up first, makes a choice

Try: "You can't fire me. I quit. And I'm taking the Johnson account with me." Shows the hero taking control, raises stakes (legal battle?), gives the actor a power moment. Make the boss fight back too—maybe threatens a lawsuit. We need COMBAT, not surrender.
```

## Dialogue Notes

### Example 1: On-the-Nose Dialogue

**BEFORE:**
```
MARK
I'm so angry right now. You betrayed me
and I don't think I can ever forgive you.
```

**NOTE:**
```
Page 67, lines 12-14: Dialogue is on-the-nose. Characters shouldn't SAY their emotions, they should EXPRESS them through what they do/say about something else.

Try:
MARK
(dead calm)
You should go.

LISA
Mark, please—

MARK  
(still not looking at her)
Leave your key.

The CONTROL in his voice shows his rage more than yelling would. Subtext: He's already decided she's dead to him.
```

### Example 2: Exposition Dump

**BEFORE:**
```
DOCTOR
The temporal displacement device uses quantum
entanglement to create a localized field that...
(continues for 8 lines)
```

**NOTE:**
```
Page 89, lines 5-12: Cut the science exposition. Nobody cares HOW it works, they care IF it works.

Replace with:
DOCTOR
It'll send you back. Once. If it doesn't kill you first.

PROTAGONIST
What are the odds?

DOCTOR
(pause)
Do you really want to know?

Now we have TENSION instead of a lecture. The science is movie magic—we just need to believe it's dangerous.
```

### Example 3: Weak Subtext

**BEFORE:**
```
JANE
I love you.

TOM
I love you too.
```

**NOTE:**
```
Page 102: The "I love you" exchange is flat. These are the last words before Tom goes to war—make them ACHE.

Try avoiding the word "love" entirely:

JANE
Come back to me.

TOM
(touching her face)
Every day. I'll come back every single day.

(They both know he might not)

The UNSAID "I love you" is more powerful than saying it. Let the actors play the fear beneath the promise.
```

## Character Arc Notes

### Example 1: Unclear Transformation

**PROBLEM:** Hero ends in same place they started

**NOTE:**
```
The arc is unclear. Page 15 Gina is selfish and career-obsessed. Page 110 she's... still selfish and career-obsessed, but with a boyfriend?

SOLUTION: Give her a CHOICE in Act 3 that proves she's changed:
- Page 105: Make her choose between the promotion (her want) and saving her sister's business (her need)
- She chooses the sister
- Loses the promotion but gains self-worth
- SHOWS transformation through action, not words

Setup needed: Page 40, plant a memory of their grandmother's dying wish that they "take care of each other." Pays off when Gina honors that instead of her ambition.
```

### Example 2: Passive Protagonist

**PROBLEM:** Things happen TO the hero, hero doesn't drive story

**NOTE:**
```
The protagonist is too passive. Examples:
- p.20: Discovers the murder (coincidence)
- p.45: Villain attacks her (reactive)
- p.78: Clue falls in her lap (coincidence)
- p.95: Sidekick solves the mystery (not her)

SOLUTION: Make her the ACTIVE force:
- p.20: She's INVESTIGATING because her dad was a cop (personal motivation)
- p.45: SHE sets a trap for the villain (tactical)
- p.78: SHE decodes the message through her art background (uses her skills)
- p.95: SHE has the revelation, sidekick just confirms it (her win)

This is her story—make sure she's driving it.
```

## Pacing Notes

### Example 1: Sagging Middle

**PROBLEM:** Act 2 drags from pages 55-75

**NOTE:**
```
Pages 55-75 feel slow. You have three scenes of the hero "researching" that could be one montage. Cut:
- Library scene (p.58-61)
- Internet cafe scene (p.65-68)  
- Bookstore scene (p.70-73)

REPLACE with:
- p.58: Quick montage (30 seconds): hero researching, frustrated, getting nowhere
- p.59: UNEXPECTED ALLY appears with the answer (introduces new character earlier, adds energy)

Saves 15 pages, maintains momentum, introduces ally when we need fresh dynamics.
```

### Example 2: Rushed Climax

**PROBLEM:** Final battle is only 2 pages

**NOTE:**
```
Page 98-100: Climax is too fast. We've built 100 minutes to this showdown—give it room to breathe.

EXPAND to 8-10 pages:
- False victory: Hero thinks they've won (p.98-99)
- Reversal: Villain reveals backup plan (p.100-101)
- True crisis: Hero must make impossible choice (p.102-103)
- Climax: The choice and its consequence (p.104-106)
- Resolution: Aftermath, new equilibrium (p.107-108)

Reference: Watch how *The Dark Knight* Joker ferry scene builds its climax. Multiple beats, escalating tension, earned resolution. That's your model.
```

## Production-Aware Notes

### Example 1: Budget Concern

**NOTE:**
```
Page 45-78: You have 14 different locations in Act 2. Each location change costs time and money (company moves, new permits, lighting). 

CONSOLIDATION suggestion:
- Coffee shop (p.45) + Bar (p.52) + Restaurant (p.61) = ONE "neutral meeting place" they return to
- Shows passage of time through costume changes, not location changes
- Saves 2 locations = ~$50K in production costs

Makes it more shootable while maintaining story.
```

### Example 2: Actor Appeal

**NOTE:**
```
The lead role needs a "showcase moment" for casting. Right now it's all plot, no emotional spotlight.

ADD: Page 67 after the betrayal reveal, give protagonist a raw monologue or a silent breakdown scene (think Viola Davis in *Fences*). 

This:
1. Gives actors something to audition with
2. Attracts talent ("This is an ACTING role")
3. Creates an awards clip
4. Deepens audience connection

Without it, A-listers won't respond to the script.
```

## Structure Notes

### Example 1: Missing Midpoint

**NOTE:**
```
The midpoint (should be around p.55) is weak. Currently: Hero learns villain's name. That's information, not a REVERSAL.

MIDPOINT should shift the story's direction:

CURRENT: Hero chasing villain
BETTER MIDPOINT: Villain starts chasing HERO

Example: p.55, villain discovers hero's identity. Now the hunter becomes hunted. Entire second half has new energy because the power dynamic flipped.

Reference: *The Fugitive* - midpoint is when the one-armed man sees Kimble. Changes everything.
```

### Example 2: Weak Inciting Incident

**NOTE:**
```
Page 1-15: The inciting incident happens too late (p.15). We need the story hook by page 10-12 maximum.

CURRENT structure:
- p.1-10: Normal world (too long)
- p.15: Inciting incident

TIGHTEN to:
- p.1-3: Normal world (establish who they are)
- p.4: Catalyst (something feels wrong)
- p.10: Inciting incident (can't go back)

Cut the dinner party scene (p.6-9)—use that page count for stronger Act 2 later. Get to the story faster.
```

## Polish Notes

### Example 1: Format Issues

**NOTE:**
```
Formatting errors throughout:

- Character names inconsistent: "SARAH" (p.12), "Sara" (p.45), "SARA" (p.78)—pick ONE
- Action blocks too dense: p.34 has a 9-line paragraph. Break into chunks of 3 lines max
- Dialogue overly attributed: We don't need "(angrily)" or "(sadly)"—let the words convey emotion
- Missing sluglines: p.56, interior changes to car but no new slugline

Use: https://www.oscars.org/nicholl/screenwriting-resources for industry standard

These small errors signal "amateur" to readers. Polish them.
```

## The Note-Giving Session

When delivering notes:

**DO:**
- Start with what works: "The opening is fantastic—grab with that funeral scene"
- Use page numbers always
- Offer solutions, not just problems
- Prioritize: "The three big fixes are..."

**DON'T:**
- Rewrite the script yourself (it's THEIR story)
- Give 100 notes at once (overwhelming)
- Be vague  
- Forget to encourage

**Remember:** Notes are meant to make the script BETTER, not prove you're smart.
