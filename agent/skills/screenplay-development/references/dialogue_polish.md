# Dialogue Polish: Natural Speech & Subtext

Guide to elevating dialogue from functional to exceptional.

## Core Principles

**Great dialogue is NOT realistic—it's BETTER than realistic.**

Real conversations have:
- Filler words ("um," "like," "you know")
- Tangents and interruptions
- Mundane small talk

Screen dialogue is:
- Purposeful (every line serves character or plot)
- Economical (say more with less)
- Rhythmic (has musicality)
- Layered (subtext beneath surface)

## The Subtext Principle

**People rarely say what they mean. Characters shouldn't either.**

### Example 1: The Breakup Scene

❌ **ON-THE-NOSE:**
```
MARK
I don't love you anymore and I want to break up.

LISA
That hurts my feelings. I'm very sad.
```

✅ **WITH SUBTEXT:**
```
MARK
(packing a suitcase)
Did you ever actually listen when I talked?

LISA
(watching him fold shirts precisely)
You fold them exactly like your mother.

MARK
(stops)
Yeah. I do.

(The SILENCE says everything: He's become what he feared, she sees it, they both know it's over)
```

**Why it works:** They're talking about folding shirts, but we FEEL the relationship dying.

### Example 2: Power Dynamics

❌ **STATED:**
```
BOSS
I have power over you and you should fear me.

EMPLOYEE
I am afraid of you.
```

✅ **SHOWN:**
```
BOSS
(doesn't look up from phone)
Close the door.

EMPLOYEE
(closes it, stands awkwardly)

BOSS
(finally looks up, 10 seconds later)
Sit.

(Employee sits immediately)

BOSS
You can go.

EMPLOYEE
You... wanted to see me?

BOSS
(back to phone)
Not anymore.
```

**Why it works:** Boss controls timing, space, attention = power. No exposition needed.

## Dialogue Techniques

### 1. Conflict in Every Exchange
Even mundane scenes should have tension:

❌ **FLAT:**
```
ALICE
Want coffee?

BOB
Sure, thanks.
```

✅ **TENSION (even subtle):**
```
ALICE
Coffee?

BOB
(doesn't look up from laptop)
If you're making it.

ALICE
(beat)
I asked if you wanted it. Not if I should be your waitress.

BOB
(finally looks up)
...I'll get it myself.
```

**Lesson:** Even coffee has stakes if characters are in conflict.

### 2. Character Voice
Each character should sound distinct:

**Techniques:**
- **Word choice**: Educated vs. street, formal vs. casual
- **Sentence structure**: Long-winded vs. clipped
- **Speech patterns**: Repeats phrases, uses metaphors, swears, etc.

**Example - Three characters, same information:**

PROFESSOR:
```
The phenomenon you're describing is, in essence, a temporal paradox.
```

MECHANIC:
```
Yeah, you basically screwed with time. It's gonna bite ya.
```

TEENAGER:
```
So like... you effed up the space-time thing? Dude. That's wild.
```

**Test:** Cover character names. Can you tell who's speaking? If not, voices aren't distinct enough.

### 3. Show Emotion Through Action, Not Dialogue

❌ **TELLING:**
```
JAKE
I'm so angry I could scream!
```

✅ **SHOWING:**
```
(Jake stands, calm. Too calm. Picks up his glass. Sets it down precisely.)

JAKE
...You should leave.

(The CONTROL is more terrifying than yelling)
```

### 4. Use Interruption & Overlapping Speech

Real conflict involves people talking over each other:

```
SARAH
If you'd just listen for one—

TOM
—I have been listening! For three goddamn—

SARAH
—No, you've been WAITING to talk, that's not—

TOM
—Oh here we go with the therapy-speak—
```

**Format tip:** Em-dashes show interruption.

### 5. The Iceberg Principle

90% of dialogue depth is what's UNSAID.

**Example:**
```
FATHER
(at daughter's wedding)
Your mother would've...

(Can't finish. Cries instead.)

DAUGHTER
(hugs him)
I know, Dad. I know.
```

**What's unsaid:**
- "...been so proud"
- "I miss her"
- "I wish she was here"
- "I'm sorry I can't be happy today"

The PAUSE communicates all of it.

## Dialogue Red Flags

### 1. Exposition Dumping
If a character knows it, they wouldn't say it:

❌ **UNNATURAL:**
```
DOCTOR
As you know, you're my patient with stage 4 cancer, and we've been treating you for six months with chemotherapy, but the tumor hasn't shrunk.
```

✅ **NATURAL:**
```
DOCTOR
(looks at chart)
It's not shrinking.

(Patient's face falls - we know enough)
```

### 2. Overly Formal Speech
Unless period/specific character choice, people use contractions:

❌ **STIFF:**
```
I do not think that is a good idea. We should not proceed.
```

✅ **NATURAL:**
```
Bad idea. We shouldn't do this.
```

### 3. Answering Directly
People deflect, avoid, change subject:

❌ **TOO DIRECT:**
```
WIFE
Are you having an affair?

HUSBAND
Yes, I am having an affair with my secretary.
```

✅ **REALISTIC EVASION:**
```
WIFE
Are you having an affair?

HUSBAND
(long pause)
Do you want me to say yes? Is that what you need to hear?
```

**Subtext:** He didn't deny it. We know the answer.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Rhythm & Musicality
Dialogue has beats like music:

**SHORT SENTENCES = URGENCY**
```
Run. Now. Don't look back.
```

**LONG SENTENCES = VULNERABILITY/RAMBLING**
```
I just... I don't know how to explain this without sounding crazy, but when I saw you standing there with her I realized that for the longest time I've been lying to myself about what I actually want and—
```

**MIX = DYNAMIC CONVERSATION**

### 2. The "Yes, And" vs "No, But"
Improv principle applies to dialogue:

**"Yes, And" = Agreement pushes forward**
```
A: We should rob the bank.
B: Yes. And I know the guard's schedule.
```

**"No, But" = Conflict creates friction**
```
A: We should rob the bank.
B: No. But I know someone who can.
```

Both work, different energy. Choose based on scene goal.

### 3. Callback & Payoff
Plant phrases early, pay them off later:

**Setup (Act 1):**
```
MENTOR
Sometimes you gotta lose the battle to win the war.
```

**Payoff (Act 3):**
```
HERO
(about to sacrifice himself)
Lose the battle... win the war.
```

Audiences LOVE this. Creates emotional resonance.

## Genre-Specific Dialogue

### Action/Thriller
- **Clipped**: One-liners, declarations
- **Urgent**: No time for philosophy
- **Cool**: Wit under pressure

**Example:** "Yippee-ki-yay" (Die Hard)

### Drama
- **Emotional**: Raw, vulnerable
- **Complex**: Layered meaning
- **Truthful**: Feels real even if heightened

**Example:** "I coulda been a contender" (On the Waterfront)

### Comedy
- **Timing**: Rhythm is everything
- **Surprise**: Unexpected word choices
- **Specificity**: Details are funnier than generalities

**Example:** "As you wish" (Princess Bride)

### Romance
- **Intimate**: Personal revelations
- **Yearning**: What's unspoken matters
- **Poetic**: Can be slightly heightened

**Example:** "You had me at hello" (Jerry Maguire)

## Dialogue Rewrite Checklist

Before finalizing, check:

- [ ] Can I cut the first 2 lines? (warm-up dialogue)
- [ ] Are characters saying what they FEEL or what they THINK?
- [ ] Is there subtext? What's beneath the surface?
- [ ] Does each character sound distinct?
- [ ] Can we SHOW this instead of SAYING it?
- [ ] Are they arguing or just explaining?
- [ ] Any exposition dumps? How to dramatize instead?
- [ ] Read aloud - does it flow naturally?
- [ ] Any repeated words/phrases (unless intentional)?
- [ ] Does it sound like real people or a screenplay?

## The Read-Aloud Test

**CRITICAL:** Always read dialogue aloud.

Listen for:
- Awkward phrasing
- Unnatural rhythm
- Lines that don't "land"
- Mouthful words actors will struggle with

If YOU stumble reading it, actors will too.

## Final Wisdom

**Aaron Sorkin's rule:** "Intention and obstacle. Every line has what the character wants and what's in their way."

**Quentin Tarantino's rule:** "Characters talk like real people, not like movie people talking."

**Diablo Cody's rule:** "Specificity is your friend. 'Pop-Tart' is funnier than 'breakfast pastry.'"

**Your rule:** Less is more. Cut until it hurts, then cut two more lines.
