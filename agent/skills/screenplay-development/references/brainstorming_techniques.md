# Brainstorming Techniques for Screenplay Development

Guide for testing and developing strong screenplay concepts before committing to a full draft.

## The Premise Test

A strong premise should pass these tests:

### 1. The One-Sentence Test
Can you pitch it in one compelling sentence?

**Formula:** `[PROTAGONIST] must [ACTION] or else [STAKES]`

**Examples:**
- ✅ "A grieving widow must solve her husband's murder before the killer frames her for it"
- ✅ "An astronaut stranded on Mars must engineer his survival until rescue arrives"
- ❌ "A woman deals with loss and discovers herself" (Too vague)

### 2. The "So What?" Test
Why should anyone care?

Ask 3 levels deep:
- What happens? (Plot)
- Why does it matter to the character? (Stakes)
- Why does it matter to US? (Universal theme)

**Example:**
- Plot: Woman hunts serial killer
- Character Stakes: He killed her sister
- Universal Theme: How far would YOU go for justice/revenge?

### 3. The Fresh

ness Test
How is this different from similar stories?

**Techniques:**
- **Flip the genre**: Rom-com but in a murder mystery
- **Unexpected setting**: Heist film in a nursing home
- **Twist the archetype**: The mentor is the villain
- **Subvert expectations**: Horror where the monster wins

### 4. The Emotional Hook Test
What feeling will the audience chase for 2 hours?

**Core emotions that work:**
- Fear/Dread (Horror, Thriller)
- Hope/Triumph (Underdog story)
- Heartbreak/Catharsis (Drama, Romance)
- Joy/Laughter (Comedy)
- Rage/Justice (Revenge, Crime)

## Concept Development Questions

Work through these systematically:

### Protagonist Clarity
- Who is the hero? (Name, age, occupation)
- What do they WANT? (External goal)
- What do they NEED? (Internal growth)
- Why are they the ONLY one who can do this?
- What's their greatest flaw?

### Stakes Escalation
- What happens if they fail? (Personal stakes)
- Who else suffers? (Relational stakes)
- What's the larger impact? (Global/philosophical stakes)

### Antagonist Strength
- Who/what opposes the hero?
- Why are they formidable?
- What's their motivation? (Villains are heroes of their own story)
- How are they similar to the protagonist? (Mirror character)

### World/Setting
- Where does this take place?
- Does the setting FORCE conflict? (Desert island, locked room, ticking clock)
- Is it visually interesting?
- Budget realistic?

## Brainstorming Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Logline Matrix
Create variations by swapping elements:

| Protagonist | Goal | Obstacle | Stakes |
|-------------|------|----------|--------|
| Burned-out cop | Find missing girl | Corrupt department | His last chance at redemption |
| Burned-out teacher | Pass students | School closing | Her legacy |
| Burned-out surgeon | Save patient | Medical board | His license |

**Result:** 27 different loglines to explore (3x3x3)

### Exercise 2: The "What If?" Game
Start with a normal situation, add a twist:

- What if... a routine surgery revealed the patient is an alien?
- What if... your therapist is actually your stalker?
- What if... you inherited a haunted house, but the ghost is your future self?

Iterate 10 "what ifs" before picking the best.

### Exercise 3: The Comp Mashup
"It's [MOVIE A] meets [MOVIE B]"

**Rules:**
- Choose films from different genres
- Identify the core appeal of each
- Find the unexpected fusion

**Examples:**
- "Die Hard in a haunted house" = Action + Horror
- "The Notebook but they're assassins" = Romance + Thriller
- "Jaws but the shark is a cyberterrorist" = Suspense + Tech

### Exercise 4: The Reverse Engineering
Start with a great ending, work backwards:

1. Write the LAST scene (resolution)
2. What's the climax that leads here?
3. What midpoint forces this climax?
4. What inciting incident starts this journey?

**Benefit:** Ensures your story builds to something satisfying.

## Red Flags: When to Abandon a Concept

Not every idea deserves a screenplay. Kill it early if:

- **Generic:** Too similar to existing films without fresh angle
- **Unclear Stakes:** Can't articulate why anyone cares
- **Passive Protagonist:** Things happen TO them, they don't drive action
- **Unsustainable:** Concept works for 20 minutes, not 90
- **Budget Prohibitive:** Requires $50M+ to film
- **"Message" Movie:** Preachy instead of emotional
- **Concept Without Conflict:** Sounds nice but no inherent opposition

## The Greenlight Test

Before outlining, answer:

1. **Would I pay to see this?** (Personal test)
2. **Can I name 3 similar successful films?** (Market proof)
3. **Does this excite talent?** (Actor/director appeal)
4. **Can I see the trailer?** (Marketing test)
5. **Is there a poster image?** (Visual hook)

If you answer "no" to 3+, rethink the concept.

## Collaboration: Pitching Your Idea

When sharing with development partners:

**DO:**
- Lead with the logline
- Share the emotional hook
- Mention comp titles
- Be open to feedback

**DON'T:**
- Explain the whole plot
- Defend every choice
- Dismiss concerns
- Confuse them with details

**Listen for:**
- "I'd watch that"
- "What if instead..."
- "That reminds me of..." (shows it connected)

**Red flags:**
- Confused faces
- "Interesting..." (polite dismissal)
- "Who's the audience?"

## Next Steps After Brainstorming

Once you have a solid concept:

1. Write 1-page treatment (setup, midpoint, climax)
2. Test with 3-5 people (Do they GET it? Are they excited?)
3. Begin outlining act structure
4. Use `story-grid-expert` skill for genre requirements
5. Start first draft

**Remember:** A great concept doesn't guarantee a great script, but a weak concept guarantees a weak script. Get this right first.
