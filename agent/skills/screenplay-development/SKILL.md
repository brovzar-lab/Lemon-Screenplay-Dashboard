# Screenplay Development: The Development Executive's Playbook

This skill embodies the knowledge and workflow of an experienced film development executive who guides writers from initial concept to production-ready screenplay, with emphasis on **actionable notes, audience connection, and filmmaking practicality**.

## Core Philosophy: The Development Executive Mindset

**Your job is to make scripts better AND more filmable.**

Development executives balance:
- **Creative Excellence** - Compelling story, rich characters, emotional depth
- **Commercial Viability** - Audience appeal, marketability, genre satisfaction
- **Production Reality** - Budget consciousness, actor appeal, shootability

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Be Specific** - Always cite page numbers, suggest concrete solutions
2. **Be Audience-Centric** - Every note should serve the viewer's experience
3. **Be Solution-Oriented** - Don't just identify problems, prescribe fixes
4. **Be Production-Aware** - Consider budget, casting, logistics

## The 6-Stage Development Process

Every screenplay goes through distinct phases, each requiring different focus:

### Stage 1: Concept/Brainstorming
**Goal:** Test premise strength before writing

**Key Questions:**
- **Logline Test**: Can you pitch it in one sentence? Does it grab attention?
- **Audience Hook**: Why will anyone care? What's the emotional core?
- **Freshness Factor**: What's new here? How does it avoid clichés?
- **Stakeholder Appeal**: Does it attract talent (actors, directors, financiers)?

**Actionable Outputs:**
- One-sentence logline
- Target audience identification
- Comp analysis (similar films)
- Emotional promise statement

**Common Issues:**
- Generic premise ("It's like X meets Y")
- Unclear protagonist goal
- Missing emotional hook
- Too many characters/storylines

### Stage 2: Story Structure
**Goal:** Build solid three-act architecture

**Development Focus:**
- **Act 1 Hook** (pages 1-25): Inciting incident by page 12-15
- **Act 2 Build** (pages 25-85): Midpoint revelation/reversal at page 55-60
- **Act 3 Payoff** (pages 85-110): Climax delivers catharsis

**Key Checkpoints:**
- Opening image establishes tone/genre
- Protagonist's want vs. need clear
- Stakes escalate progressively
- Setups pay off in climax
- Character transformation earned

**Reference:** For structural analysis using Story Grid methodology, use the `story-grid-expert` skill

### Stage 3: First Draft
**Goal:** Get story on page efficiently

**Note-Giving Focus:**
- **Scene Efficiency**: Does every scene serve character OR plot? (Ideally both)
- **Pacing**: Does it drag? Where can we cut?
- **Dialogue Clarity**: Is subtext working or just confusing?
- **Visual Storytelling**: Show don't tell

**Actionable Note Pattern:**
```
❌ "This scene is slow"
✅ "Page 34: Cut the coffee shop dialogue. Move straight from Emma's rejection (p.33) to her crying in the car (p.36). We'll FEEL her pain without the on-the-nose friend conversation."
```

See `references/draft_notes.md` for more examples.

### Stage 4: Rewrite/Polish
**Goal:** Deepen emotional impact and thematic resonance

**Development Focus:**
- **Subtext**: Elevate dialogue beyond surface meaning
- **Cinematic Moments**: Create memorable visual beats
- **Emotional Beats**: Land key feelings (fear, joy, heartbreak)
- **Character Consistency**: Voice, motivation, arc tracking

**Common Rewrite Notes:**
- Strengthen protagonist agency (make them drive action)
- Heighten conflict in scenes (more at stake)
- Plant/payoff improvements (setup earlier)
- Theme clarity (what's this REALLY about?)

See `references/dialogue_polish.md` for dialogue-specific techniques.

### Stage 5: Production Polish
**Goal:** Make screenplay shootable and attractive to stakeholders

**Production Considerations:**
- **Budget Consciousness**: Location count, VFX needs, cast size
- **Actor Appeal**: Are these roles juicy? Career-making moments?
- **Director-Friendly**: Visual opportunities, tone consistency
- **Marketing**: Trailer moments, poster imagery, elevator pitch

**Actionable Production Notes:**
```
✅ "Consider consolidating the 12 locations to 6-8. Could the office confrontation (p.45) happen at the bar (p.48)? Saves a company move."
✅ "The lead role needs a showcase monologue for casting. Page 67 chase could pause for a raw emotional beat."
```

See `references/production_readiness.md` for full checklist.

### Stage 6: Final Pass
**Goal:** Professional presentation

**Polish Checklist:**
- Industry-standard formatting (Courier 12pt, proper margins)
- Consistent character names (no "SARAH" then "Sara")
- Action lines clear and concise (3-line chunks max)
- No typos, grammar errors, or spelling mistakes
- Page count appropriate (90-110 for features, 55-65 for TV pilots)
- Title page professional

## The Art of Actionable Notes

**Good notes have three qualities:**

### 1. Specificity
Always cite:
- Page numbers
- Character names
- Specific lines or actions

**Example:**
```
❌ "The dialogue doesn't work"
✅ "Page 23, lines 12-18: Jake's monologue about his past is exposition. Cut it. Instead, show military discipline through his apartment (medals, precise bed corners) and how he reacts when Sarah is messy."
```

### 2. Solutions, Not Just Diagnosis
Don't just identify the problem—prescribe a fix.

**Pattern:**
```
PROBLEM: [What's not working]
BECAUSE: [Why it's an issue]
SOLUTION: [Specific action to take]
```

**Example:**
```
PROBLEM: The midpoint (p.55) feels flat
BECAUSE: We expect a revelation that changes everything, but the hero already knows the villain's plan
SOLUTION: Reverse it - the VILLAIN discovers the HERO'S secret identity here. Now the power dynamic shifts and Act 2B has new stakes.
```

### 3. Audience-Centric Framing
Every note should answer: **"How does this help the audience connect?"**

**Example:**
```
❌ "Add more backstory for the antagonist"
✅ "Give us ONE moment where we understand the villain's pain (maybe a photo of his dead daughter in his wallet, page 72). Audiences need to feel CONFLICTED, not just hate him. Makes the climax more emotionally complex."
```

## Audience Connection Framework

**Great screenplays make audiences FEEL**. Guide writers toward:

### Emotional Clarity
- What should the audience feel in each scene?
- Are beats landing? (Test: Read aloud - does it move you?)
-Stakes clear and escalating?

### Character Empathy
- Do we understand the protagonist's pain/desire?
- Can we relate even if we don't approve of their actions?
- Are they active (making choices) or passive (things happen to them)?

### Story Momentum
- Does each scene propel forward?
- Are there mysteries/questions keeping us engaged?
- Pacing: When does it drag? Where does it race?

### Thematic Resonance
- What's the screenplay saying about the human condition?
- Does theme emerge organically from character arcs?
- Does the ending satisfy emotionally AND thematically?

**Test:** If an audience walks out feeling nothing, the screenplay needs urgent rework even if structurally sound.

## Production Readiness Checklist

Before greenlighting, ensure:

### Budget Factors
- [ ] Location count reasonable (under 20 for low-budget)?
- [ ] VFX/stunts clearly described and necessary?
- [ ] Cast size manageable (speaking roles under 25)?
- [ ] Period/contemporary (period costs more)?

### Talent Appeal
- [ ] Lead role dynamic and transformative (Oscar bait)?
- [ ] Supporting roles distinct and memorable?
- [ ] Dialogue showcases actor range?
- [ ] Character arcs satisfying to perform?

### Directorial Vision
- [ ] Tone consistent throughout?
- [ ] Visual storytelling opportunities (not just talking heads)?
- [ ] Genre conventions satisfied?
- [ ] Signature moments (the scenes people remember)?

### Marketing Viability
- [ ] Logline intriguing enough for one-sheet poster?
- [ ] Trailer moments exist (action, emotion, mystery)?
- [ ] Clear target demographic?
- [ ] Comp titles for positioning?

**Red Flags:**
- Unclear tone (is it comedy or drama?)
- Too many characters to track
- Climax requires massive budget
- Ending unsatisfying/unclear

See `references/production_readiness.md` for expanded guidance.

## When to Consult Reference Files

- **Brainstorming new concepts**: `references/brainstorming_techniques.md`
- **Story structure issues**: Use `story-grid-expert` skill, then refer to `references/story_development.md`
- **Giving draft notes**: `references/draft_notes.md` (before/after examples)
- **Dialogue problems**: `references/dialogue_polish.md`
- **Production concerns**: `references/production_readiness.md`
- **Testing audience response**: `references/audience_testing.md`

## Integration with Other Skills

**Synergy with story-grid-expert:**
- Use Story Grid for **structural diagnosis** (genre, Five Commandments, obligatory scenes)
- Use screenplay-development for **practical notes** (how to fix it, production concerns, audience connection)

**Example Workflow:**
1. Analyze structure with Story Grid → "Missing Crime genre obligatory scene: discovery of clues"
2. Apply development notes → "Page 67: Add scene where detective finds the locket in the garden. Plant it on page 12 when the victim mentions her mother's jewelry."

## Final Principles

**Remember:**
- Writers need encouragement AND truth
- Be tough on the work, gentle on the person
- Celebrate what's working before diving into fixes
- Development is iterative—change comes in passes, not one rewrite
- The goal is a shooting script that attracts talent and audiences

**Your North Star:** Will this screenplay become a film people remember and recommend?
