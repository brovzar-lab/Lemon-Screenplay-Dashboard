# Story Grid Diagnosis: Identifying and Fixing Story Problems

When a story "doesn't work," the problem is always structural. This guide helps diagnose and fix common screenplay issues using Story Grid methodology.

## The Fundamental Diagnostic Question

**Does the story work?**

A story "works" when it delivers the core emotional experience promised by its genre. If audiences feel unsatisfied, confused, or cheated, the story doesn't work—regardless of beautiful prose, clever dialogue, or impressive set pieces.

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

Before deep analysis, answer these questions:

### Genre Clarity
- [ ] Can you identify the External Content Genre in one word?
- [ ] Can you identify the Internal Content Genre?
- [ ] Does every scene serve one or both genres?

### Core Structure
- [ ] Is there a clear Inciting Incident in the first 10%?
- [ ] Does the protagonist have a concrete Object of Desire?
- [ ] Is there an "All Is Lost" moment at 75%?
- [ ] Does the Climax deliver the Obligatory Scene for your genre?

### Value Shifts
- [ ] Does each scene change a value (+ to - or - to +)?
- [ ] Do we reach the Negation of the Negation at some point?
- [ ] Is the ending value different from the beginning value?

### Protagonist
- [ ] Does the protagonist make the climactic choice (not someone else)?
- [ ] Is there both a Conscious Want and Subconscious Need?
- [ ] Does the protagonist face genuine Crises (not obvious choices)?

## Common Story Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: "The Middle Sags"

**Symptoms**:
- Reader/viewer loses interest around page 40-70
- Scenes feel episodic or repetitive
- Characters seem to be "waiting" for the plot
- Subplots don't connect to main story

**Diagnosis**: Progressive Complications aren't progressive. Each complication should be MORE problematic than the last, not just different.

**Solution**:
1. List every Middle Build complication
2. Rank them by severity (1-10 scale)
3. Reorder so severity ALWAYS increases
4. Ensure each complication creates IRREVERSIBLE change
5. Cut any complication that doesn't top the previous one

**Test**: Ask of each complication—"Is this worse than before?" If no, cut or escalate it.

---

### Problem 2: "I Don't Care About the Protagonist"

**Symptoms**:
- Readers don't root for the main character
- Protagonist feels passive or reactive
- Character seems inconsistent
- Audience sympathy is with antagonist

**Diagnosis**: Protagonist lacks clear Object of Desire OR doesn't make meaningful choices.

**Solution**:
1. Define concrete, specific Want (not "be happy" but "win custody of daughter")
2. Make Want urgent—what happens if they fail?
3. Ensure protagonist ACTIVELY pursues Want (not waiting for things to happen)
4. Give them decisions with consequences
5. Create internal contradiction (Want vs. Need)

**Test**: Can you complete this sentence? "My protagonist desperately wants _____ because if they don't get it, _____."

---

### Problem 3: "The Ending Feels Unsatisfying"

**Symptoms**:
- Readers feel cheated or confused
- Resolution seems to come from nowhere
- Protagonist doesn't earn the victory/defeat
- Loose ends everywhere

**Diagnosis**: Either the Climax doesn't deliver the Obligatory Scene, or the Resolution contradicts what was set up.

**Solution**:
1. Identify your genre's Obligatory Core Event
2. Ensure your Climax IS that event
3. Make sure protagonist's CHOICE creates the outcome
4. Plant every element of the Climax in the setup
5. Cut any resolution element that wasn't foreshadowed

**Test**: Is your ending surprising yet inevitable? Could a careful reader have predicted it while still being moved by it?

---

### Problem 4: "Scenes Feel Pointless"

**Symptoms**:
- Scenes are "pretty" but don't advance story
- Dialogue is clever but empty
- Readers skim or skip sections
- No tension in individual scenes

**Diagnosis**: Scenes lack the Five Commandments. A scene without all five elements is not a scene—it's a vignette.

**Solution**:
For EVERY scene, identify:
1. What's the Inciting Incident of THIS scene?
2. What complications make things worse?
3. What's the turning point (action or revelation)?
4. What's the crisis (dilemma) the character faces?
5. What do they choose (climax) and what's the result (resolution)?

**Test**: What value changes from the beginning to end of this scene? If the answer is "none," cut or rewrite.

---

### Problem 5: "The Story Feels Generic"

**Symptoms**:
- Predictable beats
- "I've seen this before" feeling
- No memorable moments
- Forgettable after viewing

**Diagnosis**: You're hitting conventions without innovation. Conventions are WHAT must happen; your unique voice is HOW.

**Solution**:
1. List every convention and obligatory scene for your genre
2. For each one, brainstorm 10 unexpected ways to deliver it
3. Choose the version that's true to your characters/world
4. Ensure you're still delivering the convention (just freshly)
5. Subvert expectations in HOW, not WHETHER

**Example**: 
- Generic: Hero fights villain in abandoned warehouse
- Fresh: Hero confronts villain at child's birthday party, must defeat them without revealing truth to innocent kids

---

### Problem 6: "There's No Tension"

**Symptoms**:
- Easy reading but forgettable
- No page-turner quality
- Characters solve problems too easily
- Stakes feel theoretical, not visceral

**Diagnosis**: Crises aren't true dilemmas. If one choice is obviously better, there's no tension.

**Solution**:
1. Examine every Crisis in your script
2. Each must be either Best Bad Choice or Irreconcilable Goods
3. Make both options have real costs
4. Ensure audience can argue for either choice
5. Add clock/deadline pressure where possible

**Test**: Would half your audience choose Option A and half choose Option B? If not, it's not a real crisis.

---

### Problem 7: "It Doesn't Feel Like [Genre]"

**Symptoms**:
- Marketed as thriller but readers don't feel thrilled
- Called a love story but romance feels secondary
- Genre expectations unmet
- Audience feels deceived

**Diagnosis**: Missing conventions or obligatory scenes for your genre. Every genre has promises that MUST be kept.

**Solution**:
1. Reference `genre_guide.md` for your genre's requirements
2. Check off each convention and obligatory scene
3. If missing, add it
4. If present but weak, strengthen it
5. Make sure the CORE EVENT of your genre is your CLIMAX

**Horror must deliver**: Monster attacks and seems unstoppable
**Thriller must deliver**: Hero at mercy of villain
**Love must deliver**: Proof of love that costs something
**Action must deliver**: Hero's sacrifice saves victim

---

### Problem 8: "The Subplots Don't Connect"

**Symptoms**:
- B-story feels like different movie
- Characters from A-story never interact with B-story
- Cutting B-story wouldn't affect A-story
- Tonal whiplash between stories

**Diagnosis**: Subplots aren't thematically linked to main plot.

**Solution**:
1. Define your Controlling Idea in one sentence
2. Each subplot must explore SAME theme from different angle
3. Subplot should contrast or mirror main plot
4. Characters should learn from or impact each other
5. Subplot resolution should affect main plot resolution

**Example** (The Godfather):
- A-Story: Michael's external rise to power (Crime/Society)
- B-Story: Michael's marriage to Kay (Love)
- Both explore: The cost of family loyalty

---

### Problem 9: "The Script Is Too Long/Short"

**Symptoms**:
- Script runs 140+ pages or under 85 pages
- Rushed ending or dragging middle
- Important moments don't get enough space
- Minor moments take too much space

**Diagnosis**: Structural proportions are off.

**Solution** (for standard feature):
1. Beginning Hook: 25-30 pages (25%)
2. Middle Build: 50-60 pages (50%)
3. Ending Payoff: 25-30 pages (25%)

If Middle is too long: Cut complications that don't escalate
If Middle is too short: Add complications that increase stakes
If Beginning is too long: You're delaying the Inciting Incident
If Ending is rushed: You haven't earned the climax—add more crisis

---

### Problem 10: "Notes Are Contradictory"

**Symptoms**:
- One reader says "too slow," another says "too fast"
- Feedback seems to contradict itself
- You don't know which notes to follow
- Revisions make things worse

**Diagnosis**: Surface notes mask deeper structural problems. When readers struggle to articulate issues, they often point to symptoms, not causes.

**Solution**:
1. Don't address notes directly—find underlying problem
2. Map your script to the Story Grid
3. Identify which of the Five Commandments is weak/missing
4. Fix at structural level, not surface level
5. Re-evaluate notes after structural fix

**Example**:
- Reader says: "The villain isn't scary enough"
- Surface fix: Add scary villain scenes
- Story Grid diagnosis: No "victim at mercy of villain" scene
- Real fix: Create that obligatory scene properly

## The Story Grid Editor's Six Core Questions

When diagnosing a story, answer these:

1. **What's the Genre?** (External and Internal)
2. **What are the Conventions and Obligatory Scenes?** (Are they all present?)
3. **What's the Point of View?** (Is it consistent? Is it the right choice?)
4. **What are the Objects of Desire?** (Want and Need—are they clear?)
5. **What's the Controlling Idea?** (One sentence—can you say it?)
6. **What's the Beginning Hook, Middle Build, Ending Payoff?** (Do all fifteen Commandments work?)

If you can answer all six clearly, your story likely works. If any answer is muddy, that's where to focus revision.

---

## Revision Priority Order

When time is limited, fix in this order:

1. **Global Genre** - Wrong genre = wrong promises = failure
2. **Obligatory Scenes** - Missing these = genre failure
3. **Controlling Idea** - Unclear theme = meaningless story
4. **Beginning Hook Inciting Incident** - Weak start = lost audience
5. **Ending Payoff Climax** - Weak finish = unsatisfied audience
6. **All Is Lost Moment** - Missing this = no catharsis
7. **Progressive Complications** - Flat middle = bored audience
8. **Individual Scenes** - Weak scenes = forgettable moments

Don't polish dialogue until structure is solid. Don't add set pieces until obligatory scenes work.

## Red Flags in Script Notes

When you receive these notes, here's what they often really mean:

| Note | Likely Structural Problem |
|------|--------------------------|
| "Slow start" | Inciting Incident too late or too weak |
| "Sagging middle" | Complications not escalating |
| "Rushed ending" | Crisis/Climax not properly set up |
| "Don't like protagonist" | No clear Want or protagonist is passive |
| "Confusing" | POV inconsistent or genre unclear |
| "Predictable" | Crises have obvious answers |
| "Not scary/funny/romantic enough" | Missing obligatory scenes for genre |
| "Too long" | Scenes without value shifts |
| "Ending doesn't work" | Climax isn't the genre's core event |
| "Feels episodic" | No through-line connecting scenes |
