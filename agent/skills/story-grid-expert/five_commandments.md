# The Five Commandments of Storytelling

Every unit of story—beat, scene, sequence, act, subplot, and global story—MUST contain these five elements. This is non-negotiable. A scene without all five elements is not a scene.

---

## Commandment 1: INCITING INCIDENT

The Inciting Incident upsets the life balance of the protagonist. It throws them out of their ordinary world and creates a state of disequilibrium that demands action.

### Two Types of Inciting Incidents

**CAUSAL**: Result of an active choice
- A wife leaves her husband
- A man enlists in the Marines
- A character commits a crime
- The protagonist accepts a job offer

**COINCIDENTAL**: Random, accidental, unexpected
- A man wins the lottery
- A woman takes the wrong suitcase at the airport
- A meteor is discovered heading toward Earth
- A long-lost relative suddenly appears

### Inciting Incident Rules

1. **Must arouse a reaction**: The protagonist must respond (even doing nothing is a response)
2. **Must be appropriate to Genre**: Murder mysteries require body discovery; love stories require lovers meeting
3. **Must promise the ending**: The global Inciting Incident sets up the climax
4. **Mix types**: Don't make all causal or all coincidental throughout your script

### Inciting Incident at Each Level

| Story Level | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Beat | A character makes a comment that provokes another |
| Scene | Discovery of a clue that changes investigation direction |
| Sequence | The villain's first attack on the protagonist |
| Act | The "Point of No Return" event |
| Global Story | The central event that kicks off the entire narrative |

### Film-Specific Considerations

- **Feature Films**: Global Inciting Incident should occur within first 10-15 pages
- **TV Pilots**: Often in the cold open or first act break
- **TV Episodes**: Each episode needs its own Inciting Incident plus connection to series arc

---

## Commandment 2: PROGRESSIVE COMPLICATIONS

Progressive complications make life increasingly difficult (or surprisingly easy, then difficult) for your protagonist. They escalate the stakes and reversibility of decisions.

### The Reversibility Scale

Rate each complication 1-10:
- **1-3**: Easily reversible (protagonist can go back to normal)
- **4-6**: Difficult to reverse (significant consequences)
- **7-9**: Very difficult to reverse (permanent damage likely)
- **10**: Point of No Return (impossible to go back)

Your story must progress UP this scale. Never have a later complication be LESS reversible than an earlier one.

### The Two Turning Points

Turning points are the moments when new information emerges and the character must react. They drive progressive complications.

**ACTIVE TURNING POINT**: Scene turns on character action
- A bomb explodes
- Character fires a gun
- Character kisses another character
- Character makes a public declaration

**REVELATORY TURNING POINT**: Scene turns on revelation of information
- Discovery of a clue
- Character learns a secret
- Test results arrive
- True identity is revealed

### Mixing Turning Points

Vary your turning points throughout the script:
- Action → Action → Action = "Overly plotted"
- Revelation → Revelation → Revelation = "Melodramatic soap opera"
- Mix them for narrative drive

### Progressive Complications Must:

1. **Always escalate** - Never repeat the same level of difficulty
2. **Build toward the crisis** - Each complication makes the crisis choice harder
3. **Create the "Point of No Return"** - By the end of the Middle Build, there's no going back
4. **Reflect the Genre's value spectrum** - Progressively move toward the Negation of the Negation

---

## Commandment 3: CRISIS

The crisis is the dilemma that emerges from the progressive complications. It's a QUESTION that requires a choice between two options—both with significant consequences.

### Two Types of Crisis

**BEST BAD CHOICE**: Both options are negative
- Sophie's Choice: Which child lives?
- Rocky: Fight and probably die vs. decline and live as a coward
- Character must choose the lesser evil

**IRRECONCILABLE GOODS**: Both options are positive but mutually exclusive
- Kramer vs. Kramer: Career success OR being present for son
- Stay with beloved family OR pursue life-changing career
- Character must sacrifice one good for another

### Crisis Question Format

Always frame the crisis as a question:

"Should [protagonist] do [Option A with consequences] or [Option B with consequences]?"

Examples:
- Should Clarice continue pursuing Buffalo Bill (risking her life) or abandon the case (letting the victim die)?
- Should Michael reveal the truth (destroying his family) or keep the secret (living with guilt)?
- Should Sarah accept the safe job (financial security) or start her business (risk but fulfillment)?

### Crisis Rules

1. **No easy answers**: If one option is obviously correct, it's not a real crisis
2. **Both options must cost something**: No "have your cake and eat it too"
3. **The choice reveals character**: Actions define character, not words
4. **Must arise from progressive complications**: The crisis must feel inevitable given what came before
5. **Escalate across the story**: Act 1 crisis < Act 2 crisis < Act 3 crisis

### Film-Specific Crisis Placement

- **Act 1 Crisis**: End of Beginning Hook (around page 25-30)
- **Midpoint Crisis**: Center of Middle Build (around page 55-60)
- **Act 2 Crisis**: End of Middle Build/All Is Lost moment (around page 75-85)
- **Global Crisis**: Leads directly into the climax (around page 90-100)

---

## Commandment 4: CLIMAX

The climax is the ACTIVE CHOICE the protagonist makes in response to the crisis question. It's not what happens TO the character—it's what the character DOES.

### Climax Rules

1. **Must be active**: The protagonist must DO something (even choosing to do nothing counts if it's a deliberate choice)
2. **Must be irreversible**: The action cannot be undone
3. **Must answer the crisis question**: Directly addresses the dilemma posed
4. **Reveals true character**: Shows who the protagonist really is under pressure

### The Climax is NOT:

- A revelation (that's a turning point)
- Something happening to the character (that's complication)
- A passive response (that's avoidance)
- Deus ex machina (that's cheating)

### Climax Examples

| Genre | Crisis Question | Climax |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Thriller | Stay hidden or confront killer? | Protagonist attacks the villain |
| Love | Tell the truth or protect loved one? | Character confesses everything |
| Crime | Follow the law or do what's right? | Detective breaks protocol to catch criminal |

### Film-Specific Climax Considerations

- **Feature Films**: Global climax typically pages 95-110
- **TV Episodes**: Mini-climax before each act break, episode climax in final act
- **TV Pilots**: Pilot climax should establish series engine

---

## Commandment 5: RESOLUTION

The resolution shows the NEW EQUILIBRIUM after the climax. Life will never be the same—for better or worse, the protagonist has been transformed.

### Resolution Must Show:

1. **The new world order**: What has changed?
2. **Character transformation**: How is the protagonist different?
3. **Value shift**: Where does the core value now stand? (+ or -)
4. **Consequences of the climax**: The aftermath of the choice

### Resolution Types

**POSITIVE RESOLUTION** (+)
- Protagonist achieves goal
- World is improved
- Growth is evident
- Examples: Rocky (personal victory), The Shawshank Redemption (freedom)

**NEGATIVE RESOLUTION** (-)
- Protagonist fails
- World is worse
- Character is diminished or destroyed
- Examples: Chinatown (evil wins), Requiem for a Dream (destruction)

**IRONIC RESOLUTION** (+/-)
- External success but internal failure (or vice versa)
- Bittersweet outcome
- Complex emotional response
- Examples: The Godfather (power but lost soul), The Social Network (wealth but loneliness)

### Resolution Length

- **Scenes**: 1-3 beats after climax
- **Sequences**: 1-2 scenes after climax
- **Acts**: Brief scene establishing new status quo
- **Global Story**: Final scene(s) showing transformed world

### Film-Specific Resolution

- **Features**: Keep it brief—don't overstay your welcome after the climax (usually 5-10 pages max)
- **TV Episodes**: Resolution should create hook for next episode
- **Series Finales**: Resolution should feel complete while honoring the journey

## Applying the Five Commandments

### Scene Analysis Checklist

For EVERY scene, identify:

□ **Inciting Incident**: What event disrupts the scene's status quo?
□ **Progressive Complications**: How does difficulty escalate?
□ **Turning Point**: Action or Revelation?
□ **Crisis**: What's the dilemma? Best Bad Choice or Irreconcilable Goods?
□ **Climax**: What ACTIVE CHOICE does the character make?
□ **Resolution**: What's the new status quo?

### If You Can't Find All Five:

1. **No clear Inciting Incident?** → Scene may be unnecessary or needs stronger hook
2. **Complications don't escalate?** → Rework to increase stakes
3. **No turning point?** → Scene is static—add Action or Revelation
4. **Crisis is obvious?** → Make both options equally compelling
5. **Climax is passive?** → Force the character to ACT
6. **Resolution unclear?** → Show the changed value state

### Story Grid Scene Log

Track each scene:

```
Scene #: ___
Event: [What happens]
Inciting Incident: [Causal/Coincidental]
Turning Point: [Action/Revelation]
Crisis: [Best Bad Choice/Irreconcilable Goods]
Climax: [Character's active choice]
Value Shift: [Starting value → Ending value]
```
