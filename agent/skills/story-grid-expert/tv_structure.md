# Story Grid for Television Writing

Television has unique structural demands that differ from features. This guide adapts Story Grid methodology for episodic storytelling.

---

## TV vs. Feature Structure

| Element | Feature Film | TV Episode | TV Series |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Runtime | 90-180 min | 22-60 min | 8-100+ hours |
| Structure | 3-act, closed | Multi-act, semi-closed | Serialized arcs |
| Protagonist | Transforms by end | Maintains status quo OR slow transformation | Evolves over seasons |
| Resolution | Complete | Episode resolved, series continues | Season arcs + series arc |

---

## Episode Structure by Format

### Half-Hour Comedy (22 minutes)
**Act Structure**: Cold Open + 2-3 Acts

```
COLD OPEN (1-2 pages)
- Inciting Incident or comedic hook
- Establishes episode's A-story problem

ACT ONE (8-10 pages)
- A-story complication
- B-story introduction
- First act break: A-story crisis

ACT TWO (8-10 pages)  
- A-story escalation
- B-story development
- Climax and resolution

TAG (1 page)
- Button joke or character moment
```

**Story Grid Application**:
- A-Story: External situation comedy
- B-Story: Relationship/character moment
- Five Commandments compressed but ALL present in each act

### One-Hour Drama (42-58 minutes)
**Act Structure**: Teaser + 4-6 Acts (depending on commercial breaks)

```
TEASER/COLD OPEN (2-5 pages)
- Hook: Inciting Incident of episode
- Establishes stakes immediately

ACT ONE (10-12 pages)
- A-story investigation/complication begins
- B-story introduced
- C-story seeded (if applicable)
- Act break: First turning point

ACT TWO (10-12 pages)
- A-story escalates
- B-story complication
- Act break: Major revelation or action

ACT THREE (10-12 pages)
- A-story crisis approaches
- B-story reaches crisis
- Act break: All Is Lost moment

ACT FOUR (8-10 pages)
- A-story climax
- B-story resolution
- Episode resolution with series hook

ACT FIVE (if applicable) (5-8 pages)
- Denouement
- Setup for next episode/ongoing arcs
```

### Streaming Drama (No Commercial Breaks)
**Act Structure**: Flexible, typically 4-5 acts by story logic

Without commercial breaks, acts are determined by story needs rather than advertising. However, still structure around:
- Clear Inciting Incident within first 10%
- Midpoint shift at 50%
- All Is Lost at 75%
- Climax at 85-90%

## The TV Series Engine

A TV series needs a **repeatable engine**—a premise that generates infinite stories.

### Series Engine Components

1. **Setting/World**: Where does the show take place?
2. **Protagonist(s)**: Who are we following?
3. **Weekly Problem Generator**: What creates new stories each episode?
4. **Central Relationship(s)**: What dynamics drive B-stories?
5. **Series Question**: What overarching mystery/goal drives the series?

### Engine Examples

**Procedural Engine** (Case of the Week):
- Crime shows: New crime each episode
- Medical shows: New patient each episode
- Legal shows: New case each episode

**Serialized Engine** (Ongoing Story):
- Character pursuing long-term goal
- Mystery being solved over season
- Relationship developing over time

**Hybrid Engine** (Most Modern Dramas):
- Procedural A-story (resolved in episode)
- Serialized B-story (continues across episodes)
- Seasonal C-arc (resolved at season end)
- Series D-arc (resolved in series finale)

## Story Grid for TV Pilots

The pilot must accomplish more than a regular episode:

### Pilot Requirements

1. **Establish the World**: Genre, tone, rules, setting
2. **Introduce Protagonist**: Who they are NOW and what they WANT
3. **Demonstrate the Engine**: Show how the series will generate stories
4. **Create Investment**: Why should we watch episode 2?
5. **Promise the Series**: Hint at longer arcs to come

### Pilot Foolscap

```

## Character Transformation in TV

### Episodic/Procedural Shows
- Protagonist remains largely unchanged
- Supporting characters may have small arcs
- Status quo restored each episode
- Example: Law & Order, NCIS

### Serialized Shows
- Protagonist transforms slowly over seasons
- Supporting characters have significant arcs
- Status quo shifts seasonally
- Example: Breaking Bad, The Americans

### Hybrid Approach
- Episodic external stories (case resolved)
- Serialized internal stories (character growth)
- Example: Better Call Saul, The Good Wife

---

## Multi-Episode Story Grid

### Season Arc Structure

Apply the Five Commandments to the entire season:

```
SEASON ARC FOOLSCAP
===================

INCITING INCIDENT (Episodes 1-2):
What disrupts the season's status quo?

PROGRESSIVE COMPLICATIONS (Episodes 3-8):
How do things get progressively worse/more complex?

CRISIS (Episode 9 or penultimate):
What impossible choice does the protagonist face?

CLIMAX (Finale or penultimate):
What active choice does the protagonist make?

RESOLUTION (Finale):
What is the new status quo going into next season?
```

### Episode Placement Guide

| Episode | Season Function |
|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Season Inciting Incident |
| 2-3 | Establish new status quo, introduce season players |
| 4-5 | Progressive complications, subplots develop |
| 6 | Midpoint shift (major revelation or turning point) |
| 7-8 | Escalating complications, All Is Lost approaches |
| 9 | Season crisis, setup for finale |
| 10 | Season climax and resolution |

## B-Story and C-Story Management

Television episodes typically run multiple storylines:

### A-Story (Primary)
- Gets most screen time (60-70%)
- Contains all Five Commandments fully developed
- Usually related to series engine

### B-Story (Secondary)  
- Gets moderate screen time (20-30%)
- Contains compressed Five Commandments
- Often character/relationship focused
- May be serialized across episodes

### C-Story (Tertiary)
- Gets minimal screen time (10-15%)
- May contain partial Five Commandments
- Often comedic relief or world-building
- Seeds future storylines

### Weaving Stories

Each act break should ideally advance multiple storylines:
- End Act 1 on A-story turning point
- End Act 2 on B-story crisis
- End Act 3 on A-story All Is Lost
- Resolution weaves all stories together

---

## Television Genre Considerations

### Genre Conventions by Format

**Crime Procedural**: 
- Crime discovered in teaser
- Investigation spans episode
- J'accuse scene in Act 4
- Resolution shows justice (or its absence)

**Medical Drama**:
- Patient case introduced in teaser
- Diagnosis/treatment attempts fail
- Medical crisis in Act 3
- Resolution: patient outcome + character moment

**Workplace Drama**:
- Professional challenge introduced
- Personal stakes revealed
- Professional and personal collide
- Resolution affects both spheres

**Streaming Drama**:
- More flexibility in pacing
- Can delay Inciting Incident
- Multiple cliffhangers across episode
- Must create binge-worthy momentum

## Common TV Writing Mistakes

1. **Pilot doesn't demonstrate engine**: We don't see how the series generates stories
2. **Episode is all setup**: Five Commandments incomplete—no real crisis/climax
3. **A-story doesn't resolve**: Serialized shows still need episode satisfaction
4. **Character doesn't have episode want**: Even procedural protagonists need per-episode goals
5. **B-story is disconnected**: Should thematically mirror or contrast A-story
6. **Act breaks are soft**: Each act break needs to be a turning point
