# Story Grid Expert for Film & Television

This skill implements Shawn Coyne's Story Grid methodology, adapted for screenwriting. The Story Grid is an analytical tool that reveals whether a story "works" by examining its structural components, genre requirements, and value progressions.

## Core Philosophy

**A story either works or doesn't work.** The Story Grid provides objective criteria to diagnose why.

Stories work when they:
- Hook the audience with a compelling Inciting Incident
- Build progressive complications that escalate to the limits of human experience
- Pay off their genre's conventions and obligatory scenes
- Deliver surprising yet inevitable climaxes
- Transform characters irrevocably

## The Six Core Questions

Before analyzing or developing any screenplay, answer these questions:

1. **What's the Genre?** (External and Internal Content Genres)
2. **What are the conventions and obligatory scenes?**
3. **What's the Point of View?**
4. **What are the objects of desire?** (Conscious/External and Subconscious/Internal)
5. **What's the controlling idea/theme?**
6. **What is the Beginning Hook, Middle Build, and Ending Payoff?**

## The Five Commandments of Storytelling

Every unit of story (beat, scene, sequence, act, global story) MUST contain all five elements. See `references/five_commandments.md` for detailed guidance.

1. **Inciting Incident** - Causal or Coincidental event that upsets balance
2. **Progressive Complications** - Escalating difficulties with Active or Revelatory turning points
3. **Crisis** - Best Bad Choice or Irreconcilable Goods question
4. **Climax** - The active choice/decision
5. **Resolution** - The new equilibrium

## Genre Framework: The Five-Leaf Clover

Every story makes choices from five genre categories. See `references/genre_guide.md` for conventions and obligatory scenes.

### 1. TIME GENRE (Runtime)
- **Short Form**: Short films, webisodes (under 40 min)
- **Medium Form**: TV episodes, limited series (40-60 min)
- **Long Form**: Feature films (90-180 min)

### 2. REALITY GENRE
- **Factualism**: Based on true events
- **Realism**: Could happen in real life
- **Fantasy**: Requires suspension of disbelief (Human, Magical, Science Fiction)
- **Absurdism**: Deliberately unrealistic

### 3. STYLE GENRE
- Drama, Comedy, Horror, Thriller, Documentary, Musical, etc.

### 4. STRUCTURE GENRE
- **Arch-Plot**: Single active protagonist, external conflict, closed ending, linear time
- **Mini-Plot**: Multiple/passive protagonists, internal conflict, open ending
- **Anti-Plot**: Breaks all rules, no causality required

### 5. CONTENT GENRES

**External Content Genres** (Conscious Object of Desire):
- Action (Life/Death)
- Horror (Life/Damnation)
- Crime (Justice/Injustice)
- Thriller (Life/Damnation + Justice)
- Western (Individual/Society)
- War (Victory/Defeat)
- Society (varies by subgenre)
- Love (Love/Hate)
- Performance (Respect/Shame)

**Internal Content Genres** (Subconscious Object of Desire):
- **Worldview**: Education, Maturation, Revelation, Disillusionment
- **Morality**: Punitive, Redemption, Testing
- **Status**: Pathetic, Sentimental, Tragic, Admiration

## Screenplay Structure: The 25/50/25 Rule

For features:
- **Beginning Hook (Act 1)**: ~25% of runtime (~25-30 pages)
- **Middle Build (Act 2)**: ~50% of runtime (~50-60 pages)
- **Ending Payoff (Act 3)**: ~25% of runtime (~25-30 pages)

For TV pilots, adjust based on act breaks. See `references/tv_structure.md`.

## Value Progressions

Every scene must turn—shift from positive to negative or vice versa on the story's core value spectrum:

```
POSITIVE (+) → CONTRARY (+/-) → NEGATIVE (-) → NEGATION OF NEGATION (--)
```

Example for Thriller:
```
Life → Unconsciousness → Death → Damnation (Fate Worse than Death)
```

Example for Love:
```
Love → Indifference → Hate → Self-Hatred (Hate masquerading as Love)
```

## Scene Analysis Protocol

For each scene, identify:
1. **Story Event**: What happens?
2. **Value Charge**: Starting value → Ending value
3. **Turning Point**: Action or Revelation?
4. **Polarity Shift**: + to - or - to +?
5. **Five Commandments**: Present in scene?

## The Foolscap Method

One-page outline for global story. See `references/foolscap_template.md` for the template.

## A Story vs B Story

- **A Story (External)**: The visible quest for the conscious object of desire (plot)
- **B Story (Internal)**: The hidden quest for the subconscious object of desire (theme)

The interplay between these creates meaning. For deep storytelling, the protagonist may achieve one but fail the other (irony).
