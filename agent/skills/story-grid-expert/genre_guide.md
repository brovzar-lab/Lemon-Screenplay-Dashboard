# Story Grid Genre Guide for Film & Television

This reference provides conventions and obligatory scenes for each genre, adapted for screenwriting.

## Understanding Conventions vs Obligatory Scenes

**Conventions**: Elements that must be present (character types, settings, story devices) but can appear anywhere and in any form.

**Obligatory Scenes**: Specific scenes the audience expects. These are the "promises" your genre makes. Fail to deliver them innovatively and the story won't work.
