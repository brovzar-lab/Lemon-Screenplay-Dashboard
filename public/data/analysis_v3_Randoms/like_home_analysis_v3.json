      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the screenplay maintains forward momentum through escalating stakes and character deaths, the middle section could benefit from more cohesive progression. The transitions between locations sometimes feel episodic rather than building on each other."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The screenplay offers a genuinely fresh take on The Wizard of Oz, transforming it into something unrecognizable yet with clever nods to the source material. The Gulch family's dynamic and backstory feel unique in the horror landscape."
