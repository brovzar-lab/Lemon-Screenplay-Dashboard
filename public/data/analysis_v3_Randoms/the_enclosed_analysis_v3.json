      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "A medieval woman who has vowed to live her entire life in a single cell attached to a church discovers what she believes is a saint's skull, only to be terrorized by a demon that wants it back. The premise is unique, provocative, and instantly engaging with religious horror elements that create a clear high-concept horror framework."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script utilizes the confined space brilliantly, creating a strong three-act structure despite physical limitations. The grave-digging, skull discovery, and demonic encounters escalate logically. The use of memory/flashback sequences provides necessary context while maintaining tension, though some transitions could be smoother."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Brigid is a complex, flawed, yet compelling protagonist. Her religious devotion masks deeper guilt about abandoning Roslyn. She actively drives the story through her choices (digging the grave, praying to the skull, confronting the demon) and undergoes a genuine transformation when she finally faces her past. Her arc from false piety to genuine faith is well-executed."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Arild/The Girl and Roslyn are well-drawn characters with clear motivations. Father Ambrose and Goodie Maeve serve their functions effectively. The supporting cast all have distinctive voices and purposes, though some (like Julia) could be more fully developed."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The dialogue excels at capturing period-appropriate speech without becoming stilted. Each character has a distinct voice - Brigid's formal religious speech contrasts with The Girl/Arild's more modern sensibilities. The arguments between Brigid and Arild are particularly well-written, with layers of subtext and emotion."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script delivers effectively on its horror promises with genuinely unsettling imagery (the demon, Roslyn's drowning, the crucifix scene) and psychological terror. It masterfully builds tension in a confined space, creating an atmosphere of dread while exploring religious themes in a way that enhances rather than distracts from the horror elements."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The concept of a medieval anchoress fighting a demon while confined to a single cell is remarkably fresh. The script blends historical religious practices with supernatural horror in ways rarely seen in modern film. The setting, time period, and central conflict all feel distinctive and novel."
