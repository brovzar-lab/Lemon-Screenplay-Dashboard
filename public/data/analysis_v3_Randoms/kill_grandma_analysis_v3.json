    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Strong high-concept hook combining gerontophobia with vampire/memory-stealing elements. The idea of elderly people stealing youth through memories is fresh and marketable. The role reversal at the end delivers on the title's promise."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Introduces concept and escalates adequately but suffers from repetitive sequences in the second act and an overly convoluted third act with multiple endings. The screenplay could benefit from streamlining its final act and clarifying its rules."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Ashley has a clear motivation (confront grandmother) and an internal conflict (fear of aging/elderly) but her choices often feel reactive rather than active. Her character arc is present but undermined by confusing identity swaps in the third act."

      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Several memorable supporting characters with distinct voices including Chester (alpha old man), Dr. Jung (creepy villain), and Paul (skeptical fiancé). Each has their own agenda and unique characterization."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Dialogue is consistently entertaining, particularly Chester's profanity-laden rants about millennials and Jung's pseudo-scientific explanations. Characters have distinctive voices, though exposition can be on-the-nose."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Delivers on horror-comedy elements with effective gross-out moments and dark humor, but struggles with tonal consistency. Some horror sequences work well, but the constantly shifting rules of the supernatural elements undermine consistent tension."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Presents a fresh take on aging horror with the memory-stealing concept and the nursing home setting. While it incorporates familiar horror tropes, the gerontophobia angle and role-reversal provide a distinctive perspective."

      "recommendation_rationale": "Despite a strong concept (8) and memorable characters (7), the screenplay's weighted score (6.55) falls below the CONSIDER threshold. The critical failure of tone incoherence combined with structural problems in the third act would require significant development beyond 1-2 drafts."
    },
    "verdict_statement": "While 'Kill Grandma' offers a genuinely original concept with strong marketable elements and memorable characters (particularly Chester), this screenplay suffers from fundamental tonal inconsistency and a convoluted third act with multiple endings. The development investment required to address these structural issues while maintaining the script's comedic and horror strengths exceeds the value of the current material."
