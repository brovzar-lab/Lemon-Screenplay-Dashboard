    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The concept of a woman's repressed trauma manifesting as a ghostly presence that only her daughter can see is compelling and fresh. It combines psychological thriller elements with supernatural touches in an original way that explores childhood trauma through both a child and adult's perspective."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script maintains solid pacing with a clear three-act structure that builds mystery while gradually revealing the truth. The investigation flows naturally, though there are a few areas where the supernatural elements create some structural inconsistencies."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Anna is exceptionally well-drawn - a complex, flawed protagonist with serious personal issues stemming from unresolved trauma. Her arc from emotionally closed-off to healing is compelling. Her self-destructive behaviors, emotional walls, and eventual confrontation with her past create a three-dimensional character."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The supporting characters are distinct and serve the story well. Maddy is perceptive and has her own agency; Daniel provides continuity and perspective; Frank is a convincingly complex villain; and others like Gail and Simon add texture to the world."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The dialogue is generally strong with characters having distinct voices. Anna's sharp, defensive tone contrasts well with Maddy's innocent directness. Some exposition is handled a bit too directly at times, but the emotional exchanges, particularly between Anna and her father, are powerful."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script blends psychological thriller, family drama and supernatural elements effectively. The investigation into Victoria's disappearance maintains tension while the supernatural elements enhance rather than distract from the core emotional story. The final revelation delivers a satisfying twist that recontextualizes everything that came before."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While stories about repressed trauma exist, this script's approach using the dual perspectives of mother and daughter, along with the supernatural manifestation of repressed memories as a ghostly child, feels fresh. The unique structure of the mystery (investigating one disappearance that leads to uncovering a different truth) gives the familiar elements a distinctive execution."
