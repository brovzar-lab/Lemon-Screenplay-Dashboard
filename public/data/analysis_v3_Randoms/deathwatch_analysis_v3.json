      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The premise of a dying grandmother acting as a conduit for supernatural entities is compelling and original. The script effectively blends family drama with supernatural horror, creating a hook that ties personal demons to literal ones."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the script establishes clear stakes and escalates tension, the pacing is inconsistent with some repetitive sequences in the middle. The relationship between Hailey and Katie could be established earlier to strengthen the narrative spine."

      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Hailey is a well-defined protagonist with clear wants (to escape her past) and needs (to confront her guilt). Her journey from denial to acceptance is compelling, though her initial motivations could be more clearly established."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The family members are distinctive with clear personalities and dynamics. Grandpa, Marion, Zach, and even the hospice worker Roman all have memorable traits, though some characters like Angela could be more fully developed."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters have distinctive voices, particularly the family members with their Southern dialect. The script avoids on-the-nose exposition, and emotional exchanges feel authentic, though occasionally veering into melodrama."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The horror elements are well-executed with effective scares, particularly the demon attacks and ghost appearances. The script balances supernatural horror with psychological dread and family drama, though the rules of the supernatural world could be clearer."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The combination of a hospice deathwatch with supernatural horror creates a fresh angle. The twist regarding Katie and Hailey's true relationship offers a unique approach to guilt and redemption within the genre."
