    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The concept of a small craft brewery startup facing a crisis is relatable and has merit, but lacks a truly distinctive hook that would make it immediately compelling beyond the niche craft beer audience."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The script has a functional three-act structure but feels somewhat compressed at 39 pages, with limited space to fully develop character arcs and plot complications. The crisis comes relatively late with a somewhat rushed resolution."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Ben is a functional protagonist with clear goals around making his brewery successful, but his character arc (considering leaving for a corporate job vs. staying with his passion) isn't fully developed or resolved with sufficient clarity."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Joe, Gus, and Shana are reasonably well-differentiated with distinct personalities, skillsets and perspectives that complement each other well. They have individual voices and bring different energies to scenes."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The dialogue contains effective craft beer jargon that creates authenticity and humor. Characters have distinct voices, particularly Shana whose no-nonsense attitude contrasts well with the guys' beer geek enthusiasm."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "As a workplace comedy-drama, it hits expected beats but doesn't fully explore the emotional stakes or maximize comedic potential. The script knows its world but plays it somewhat safe without delivering exceptional comedy set pieces or deeply emotional moments."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The craft beer setting provides a specific backdrop, but the storyline of small business owners facing a crisis follows familiar patterns. The script competently portrays its world without bringing a highly distinctive perspective."

While it doesn't reach RECOMMEND thresholds due to its concept score of 6, short length, and lack of exceptional standout elements, the authentic world-building and character dynamics show promise."

    "verdict_statement": "This screenplay shows genuine authenticity in its depiction of craft beer culture and establishes engaging character dynamics, but requires development attention to expand its length, deepen character arcs, and strengthen its dramatic structure. With proper expansion to either feature or full pilot length and a more defined resolution for Ben's character arc, this project could achieve RECOMMEND status."
