      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "A man with perfect memory whose mother is losing hers creates a compelling ironic contrast that resonates emotionally and thematically. The premise is instantly understandable and provides rich dramatic territory."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the core narrative is clear, the script suffers from meandering subplots, especially involving Norval's character and the suicide attempt. The second act lacks clear escalation and the various threads sometimes feel disconnected."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Noel has a clear goal (cure his mother), strong motivation, and a meaningful arc from scientific obsession to emotional connection. His journey from relying on perfect memory to valuing imperfect presence is well-developed, though his passivity in middle sections weakens his agency."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Stella, Norval and Samira are multidimensional characters with their own arcs. Stella's deterioration feels authentic, Norval is colorful if sometimes distracting, and Samira has her own memory-related trauma. Dr. Vorta serves as an effective foil but borders on caricature."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters have distinct voices - Norval's witty vulgarity contrasts with Noel's precise factuality. Exchanges between Noel and his mother are particularly moving. Occasional on-the-nose moments and expository speeches prevent a higher score."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Successfully balances humor and pathos, delivering on the dramatic comedy promise while managing the serious subject of Alzheimer's with sensitivity. The film expertly portrays the devastating effects of memory loss while finding moments of levity."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The concept of perfect memory versus Alzheimer's provides a fresh angle on memory-themed stories. The synesthesia element and visualization of Noel's memory process feel innovative, though the eventual 'love is the cure' message becomes somewhat expected."

    "verdict_statement": "This screenplay shows genuine emotional depth and a compelling premise in contrasting perfect memory against Alzheimer's, but requires development attention to structural pacing and subplot integration. With tightened second act focus and more meaningful escalation in Noel's journey, this project could achieve RECOMMEND status."
