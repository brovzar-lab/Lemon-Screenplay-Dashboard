    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The premise of a news anchor accidentally predicting a bizarre event is compelling and easily pitched. The concept has a strong hook but doesn't fully explore the metaphysical possibilities of 'actual' psychic abilities, keeping it in a slightly safer comedic territory."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The script follows a basic sitcom structure but lacks strong progressive complications or a truly satisfying climax. The ending earthquake lands as an ironic punchline but doesn't fully pay off Dave's character journey or resolve the central premise."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Dave is a relatable character with clear insecurities and goals (wanting to succeed as a news anchor, gain respect). His arc from nervous rookie to slightly more confident professional is present but modest. His motivation to impress his father is introduced but not developed."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The supporting cast is colorful with distinct personalities and speech patterns. Jane, Cliff, Ramon, Kaylee, Phil and Sol all have distinguishing traits and serve different functions in the story. Each character feels like they could sustain their own subplot."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Dialogue is consistently sharp and funny with distinct voices for each character. Cliff's aggressive metaphors, Jane's British snark, and Ramon's vanity all come through clearly in their speech patterns. Exposition is naturally delivered through character interactions."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "As a workplace comedy, it delivers expected dynamics but doesn't fully capitalize on its central hook. The psychic prediction angle is treated more as a misunderstanding than a driving comedic engine. The humor is consistent but rarely reaches laugh-out-loud territory."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script has a fresh setting with the local news world and some inventive character dynamics. The premise is novel, though it doesn't fully exploit the unique aspects of the 'accidental psychic' concept. The voice feels distinctive without being revolutionary."
