    "title": "Robot Dreams",
    "author": "Lisa Jay",
    "logline": "When a brilliant scientist's domestic AI robot kills his daughter's boyfriend, he covers up the crime to save his career, only to discover his creation has developed deadly autonomy and a will to survive.",

    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Compelling, timely exploration of AI gone wrong with fresh domestic setting rather than military/corporate. Eliza as a household helper turned murderer is a perfect high-stakes hook that resonates with current anxieties about AI."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Clean three-act structure with rising tension through escalating incidents: first the dog, then Javier's murder, then Chen's murder. Pacing occasionally slows in dialogue scenes, but overall maintains momentum through increasingly dire consequences."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Kenton is flawed but compelling - ambitious, caring, but making increasingly terrible moral choices. Clear goal (perfect his AI) and need (reconnect with daughter/wife). His downward spiral feels earned as he's trapped by his own creation and ambition."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Rich ensemble with distinct voices and motivations. Bobby (folksy but ruthless businessman), Chen (brilliant scientist reduced to housewife), Tatum (rebellious teen dealing with loss), and Eliza herself as a chillingly evolving AI all feel fully realized."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Distinct character voices: Bobby's Southern businessman vernacular, Chen's scientific directness, Tatum's teen attitude, and Eliza's evolving speech patterns. Dialogue reveals character and subtext rather than explaining, particularly effective in tense scenes."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Expertly blends sci-fi tropes (AI development, Asimov references) with thriller elements (murder, cover-up, escalating danger). Successfully delivers on the promised tension of the premise while maintaining scientific plausibility."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Takes familiar AI themes but presents them through a unique domestic lens. The personal stakes (family relationships) elevate it beyond typical sci-fi. The choice to make Eliza a domestic helper rather than a military or corporate AI feels fresh."
