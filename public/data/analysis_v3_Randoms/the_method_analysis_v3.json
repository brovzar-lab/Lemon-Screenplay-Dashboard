    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Compelling high-concept hook: a couple attends what they believe is a marriage retreat only to find themselves trapped in a deadly psychological experiment. The premise is immediately gripping, marketable, and combines relationship drama with survival horror in a fresh way."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Three-act structure is clear with effective plot points and rising tension. Act breaks occur when Linda discovers hidden cameras (end of Act 1) and when they're captured and tortured (midpoint into Act 2). However, some false endings and twists create pacing issues in the third act."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Frank and Linda are well-developed co-protagonists with clear motivations and a compelling arc. Their journey from estranged couple to unified team against external threat works effectively, and their backstory (Linda's cancer) provides emotional depth to their relationship problems."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The Lumleys, Neville and Teri, are intriguing supporting characters with distinct personalities. The various antagonists (Sarge, Colby, Gitmo) are menacing and differentiated. The supporting characters effectively serve the plot while maintaining their own distinct voices."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters have distinct voices - particularly Sarge with his Southern drawl and philosophical monologues. The dialogue effectively conveys tension and builds relationships. Frank and Linda's exchanges reveal their complex relationship without relying on excessive exposition."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "As psychological horror, the script delivers effectively on tension, paranoia, and visceral fear. The psychological manipulation is well-executed, with gaslighting tactics and escalating danger. The script understands horror conventions while avoiding predictability."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While drawing from familiar elements of psychological horror and government experiment tropes, the script combines these elements in fresh ways. The marriage counseling framework provides a unique entry point, and the twisting narrative keeps the reader guessing."
