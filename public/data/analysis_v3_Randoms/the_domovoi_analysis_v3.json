    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Blends Eastern European folklore with contemporary horror in a fresh way that explores childhood trauma through a supernatural lens. The concept of a house spirit that grants wishes with terrible consequences is inherently compelling and marketable."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Well-constructed with clear escalation of stakes, though some middle sections feel episodic with multiple attempts to defeat the monster. Maintains tension through most of the screenplay with effective act breaks at the wish being made, the repairman's death, and Trina deciding to confront the Domovoi."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Trina is a compelling, well-drawn protagonist with clear wants (to be safe from Richard) and needs (to find courage to protect herself). Her journey from passive wisher to active hero is well-executed, with a satisfying character arc."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Strong, distinct supporting characters. Babulya's Russian grandmother with practical survival instincts, Katya's conflicted mother, Officer Gandy's earnest cop, and even Cecil the goat all have distinguishable personalities and functions in the story."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters have distinct voices - Babulya's broken English and proverbs, Trina's mix of child-like innocence and precocious defiance. The Domovoi's dialogue is effectively menacing. Some exposition is a bit on-the-nose but generally well-handled."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Effectively delivers on horror genre expectations with genuinely terrifying moments, while successfully incorporating fairy tale elements. The blend creates a unique tone that maintains tension throughout."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Highly original fusion of Eastern European folklore with horror conventions. The use of the Domovoi as a metaphor for childhood trauma and the fairy tale framing device show a distinctive voice and approach to horror."
