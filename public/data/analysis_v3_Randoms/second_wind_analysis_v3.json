      "concept": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The hook of a washed-up wrestler finding redemption through saving his biggest fan has commercial appeal and comedic potential. It blends wrestling entertainment with a crime plot, though the premise isn't wholly original."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The script follows a traditional three-act structure but has pacing issues with extended sequences that don't advance the plot. The story takes significant time to fully establish stakes, and some revelations feel rushed in the third act."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Mike has a clear arc from self-loathing criminal to renewed hero. His journey feels authentic, with well-established flaws and motivations. His transformation is earned through his connection with Cyndi, though his initial motivation could be clearer."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Standout supporting characters, particularly Cyndi and Layla. Each has distinctive personality traits and dialogue patterns. Vern makes for an appropriately theatrical villain, and even minor characters like Heath and Tony have memorable moments."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters have distinct voices, particularly Cyndi's enthusiastic nerdiness and Layla's no-nonsense attitude. Some clever exchanges and running gags work well, though occasional exposition feels heavy-handed."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The action comedy elements deliver familiar beats but lack distinctive set pieces. The wrestling backdrop is utilized but not fully exploited. Comedy is consistent though occasionally repetitive, and the action sequences are functional rather than exceptional."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the wrestling backdrop provides some freshness, the redemption arc and kidnapping plot follow familiar patterns. The Star Trek fandom angle adds uniqueness, but the overall structure and character dynamics lean on established tropes."
