    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The concept of exploring tech industry speaking circuit culture offers a fresh lens into Silicon Valley-esque territory. It's timely and has clear potential for comedy and drama, though not instantly revolutionary."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The pilot has a clear beginning, middle and end with coherent act breaks, but some story threads feel disconnected, particularly Tate and Vanessa's storyline which doesn't fully integrate with Adam's journey until the end."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Adam is relatable and clearly defined with specific goals (become a respected speaker, maintain company success). His journey from timid tech CEO to someone willing to take risks is established well, though his arc could use more development."

      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The supporting characters are distinctive with clear personalities: Max as the brash loudmouth, Christine as the basket case, Tate as the industry veteran, and Ann as the pragmatic manager. Each brings specific energy to the show."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Dialogue is a strength with distinct character voices. Max's profanity-laden outbursts contrast with Adam's awkward hesitation. The speakers' industry jargon creates authentic tech world satire without becoming impenetrable."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The comedy works well when exploring tech industry pretentiousness and conference culture absurdity. The workplace dynamics are convincing, though some comedic setpieces (like Max's meltdown) could be more integrated into the overall narrative."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While the tech industry setting isn't new, focusing on the speaking circuit offers a fresh angle. The exploration of imposter syndrome among supposedly successful people feels authentic and provides a unique perspective."
