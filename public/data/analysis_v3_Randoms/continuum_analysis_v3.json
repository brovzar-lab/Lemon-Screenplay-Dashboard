      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Time regression limited to 24 hours with clear rules creates a fresh twist on time travel. The ACCH as a secret government agency performing timeline corrections has a strong hook with clear stakes."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The pilot follows a standard structure with clear act breaks, but suffers from pacing issues. The training sequence feels rushed, and the final act twist (the assassination test) doesn't feel fully earned."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Holt has a compelling backstory with his deceased wife driving his emotional arc. He demonstrates agency through disobeying orders to save lives and shows moral clarity in refusing to kill innocent people. His grief provides a clear motivation."

      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Rosenberg and Yasharoff have distinct personalities, but the trainee characters (Ito, Russo, Miranda) feel underdeveloped and primarily serve as plot devices. Nikolaj as the NATO antagonist is somewhat one-dimensional."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Dialogue is functional but often on-the-nose, particularly with exposition about the time regression technology. Character voices aren't consistently distinct, with many characters sounding interchangeable during training sequences."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script delivers on its sci-fi thriller premise with clear rules for its technology, high-stakes missions, and moral dilemmas. The JFK assassination opening and Capitol bombing sequences effectively establish tone and create tension."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the 24-hour time regression limitation creates an interesting constraint, many elements feel derivative of other time travel stories. The government agency structure and training sequences recall familiar spy/action tropes."

With more nuanced character development and less expositional dialogue, this project could achieve RECOMMEND status."
