      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The concept of a human-machine hybrid protagonist discovering her nature while fighting super-humans offers a fresh take on the AI singularity theme. The stakes are clear and global, with personal motivation embedded."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the script establishes the conflict early and builds to a clear climax, the middle section in Dubai feels elongated with unnecessary training sequences. The pacing is uneven with several sequences that could be tightened."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Ava has clear goals (save her sister, stop genocide) and undergoes transformation from reluctant participant to embracing her hybrid nature. Her journey has agency and purpose, though her emotional arc sometimes takes a backseat to action."

      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While Daniel has a clear antagonistic motivation and Said provides emotional support, many supporting characters (like Aesera's team) blend together. Daisuke has depth but limited screen time relative to his importance."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The dialogue efficiently conveys information but often lacks distinction between characters. Some exchanges between Ava and Said show personality, but many lines serve plot functions rather than revealing character."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script delivers on action set pieces and sci-fi world-building well. The superhuman fights and machine battles provide the spectacle audiences expect, while the philosophical questions about AI and humanity offer thematic depth."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While borrowing elements from familiar sci-fi narratives (AI rebellion, human enhancement), the hybrid protagonist and the concept of creating weapons that could destroy machines offer fresh angles. The Dubai sequence brings international scope rarely seen in this genre."
