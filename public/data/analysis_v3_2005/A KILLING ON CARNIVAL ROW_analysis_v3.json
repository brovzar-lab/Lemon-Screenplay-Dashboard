    "logline": "When a detective becomes the prime suspect in a series of faerie murders, he must partner with a wingless survivor to catch the real killer while evading the police.",

    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The blending of film noir detective story with dark fantasy creates a unique and compelling premise. A Victorian-era city where faeries and other creatures coexist with humans amid prejudice provides a fresh setting for a serial killer investigation."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script follows a clear three-act structure with logical progression, though some middle sections could be tightened. The dual mysteries (Unseelie Jack's identity and the Mayor's conspiracy) converge effectively, but some transitions between action sequences feel rushed."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Philostrate is well-developed with clear goals, meaningful relationships, and a compelling arc. His connection to faerie culture through childhood creates depth, and his transformation from detached investigator to passionate protector feels earned."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The supporting characters are distinctive and multidimensional. Vignette has her own arc and agency. The Haruspex is a memorable villain. Even minor characters like Quill, Bottom, and the Mayor have specific voices and purposes beyond plot function."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The dialogue effectively balances period style with accessibility. Characters have distinct voices - Bottom's coarse prejudice, Vignette's defiant spirit, Kasmir's formal menace. Exposition is generally well-handled through character interaction rather than info-dumps."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Successfully blends fantasy and noir elements. The script delivers on both the detective story promises (investigation, pursuit, revelation) and fantasy worldbuilding (magical creatures, supernatural threats). The urban fantasy atmosphere is consistently maintained."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The integration of Victorian-era setting with fantastical elements feels fresh. The concept of faeries as an oppressed minority provides social commentary without being heavy-handed. The mythology around twining and the Haruspex creature is inventive."
