    "title": "Juno",
    "author": "Diablo Cody",
    "logline": "A witty, independent-minded teenager navigates an unplanned pregnancy by arranging to give her baby to a seemingly perfect couple, only to discover complicated truths about adulthood, love, and what makes a family.",
    "genre": "Comedy-Drama",
    "subgenres": [

      "Responsibility",
      "Unconventional family",
      "Finding your own path",

    ],
    "tone": "Quirky, sardonic humor with genuine emotional depth",
    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Teen pregnancy isn't new territory, but the fresh approach of a sardonic, independent protagonist choosing adoption with an unconventional perspective makes this concept stand out. The hook is simple yet compelling: what happens when a teenager decides to find parents for her unborn child but gets emotionally entangled in the process?"
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The screenplay follows a clear seasonal structure (fall through summer) that tracks Juno's pregnancy. Act breaks are well-defined, with the first turning point being Juno's decision to pursue adoption, midpoint revealing deeper connection with Mark, and climax showing Mark's revelation and Juno's ultimate emotional growth."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "Juno is an unforgettable character with a distinct voice. Her goals shift organically: first trying to 'solve' her pregnancy, then finding the right parents, ultimately discovering what she values in relationships. Her transformation from glib teen to someone with genuine emotional maturity feels earned through her experiences. Perfect actor-bait role."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Nearly every character feels three-dimensional. Mac (dad), Bren (stepmom), Bleeker (boyfriend), Leah (friend), Mark and Vanessa (adoptive parents) all have distinct personalities, voices, and motivations that extend beyond serving Juno's story. Each character feels like they could carry their own film."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Incredibly distinctive voice throughout, with each character sounding different yet belonging to the same world. Juno's dialogue especially crackles with originality ('This is one doodle that can't be un-did, homeskillet'). Exposition is handled naturally, and subtext abounds in conversations between Mark/Vanessa and Juno/Bleeker."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The script delivers both as a comedy and drama. The comedic elements (Juno's sarcasm, situational humor) are balanced perfectly with the emotional weight of teen pregnancy, adoption, and coming-of-age. It successfully navigates both tones without undermining either."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The script announces a wholly original voice through its unique dialogue style, unconventional protagonist, and fresh take on pregnancy. While the premise could be conventional, the execution feels entirely new, particularly in Juno's agency and the complex portrayal of adoption dynamics."
