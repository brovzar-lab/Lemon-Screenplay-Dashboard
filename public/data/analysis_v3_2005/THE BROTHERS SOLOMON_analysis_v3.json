    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Compelling concept of socially inept brothers trying to fulfill their father's wish by having a baby. The premise provides clear comedic potential and sets up both obstacles and goals effectively."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Serviceable structure with clear progression through the surrogacy process, relationship building with Janine, and ultimate resolution. However, the second act has some meandering sections of repetitive training sequences."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Dean and John are clearly defined in their social ineptitude and genuine intentions, but their growth arc is somewhat simplistic. Their agency drives the plot, though character development happens primarily through situational comedy rather than deep introspection."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Janine has some dimension as the surrogate who grows fond of the brothers. James provides antagonistic energy, and Tara serves as a romantic interest, but most supporting characters primarily serve as foils for the brothers' social awkwardness rather than having distinct arcs."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Features numerous quotable, absurd exchanges between the brothers. Their childlike sincerity creates a distinctive voice. The brothers sound alike but that's thematically appropriate given their isolated upbringing."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Successfully delivers the absurdist comedy beats expected in this genre of socially inept protagonists. Contains effective comedic set pieces (baby training montages, awkward interactions, the airplane banner) that would satisfy the core audience."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The absurdist tone and specific comedic scenarios show a distinctive voice, but the overall 'clueless guys learn to be responsible' structure follows familiar comedy patterns. Has a recognizable Will Forte comedic sensibility."
