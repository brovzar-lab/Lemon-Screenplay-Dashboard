    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The concept of a superhero in couples therapy provides a fresh hook and comedic premise with strong potential. It combines superhero tropes with relationship drama in a potentially marketable way, though we see only the opening scene."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "With only the opening scene available, structure cannot be properly evaluated. The opening establishes character and premise but doesn't indicate how the narrative will progress."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Maxx is established as emotionally stunted with clear character flaws that create potential for growth. His superhero status contrasted with emotional unavailability creates an interesting character dynamic, though we don't yet see his goals clearly articulated."

      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Only Laura and an unnamed therapist appear in this excerpt. Laura shows personality as a strong, frustrated partner, but we don't get enough of the supporting cast to fully evaluate."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The dialogue effectively establishes character through voice - Maxx's emotional avoidance contrasts with Laura's frustration. The therapy session dialogue efficiently delivers backstory with humor."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The excerpt shows promise in blending superhero and relationship comedy elements, but with so little material, it's difficult to assess how well the genre requirements will be executed throughout."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The therapy session setup for a superhero is a fresh angle that suggests the writers have a specific voice and perspective on superhero tropes. The casual revelation of Maxx's dramatic backstory shows comedic potential."
