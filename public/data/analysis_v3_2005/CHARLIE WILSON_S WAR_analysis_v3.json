    "title": "Charlie Wilson's War",
    "author": "Aaron Sorkin",
    "logline": "A hard-partying congressman secretly partners with a CIA operative and a wealthy socialite to arm Afghan rebels against invading Soviets, changing the course of the Cold War.",

    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Exceptionally compelling true story of a little-known congressman who led a massive covert operation against the Soviets. The concept is easily pitchable, historically significant, and offers a fascinating look at how American foreign policy actually works behind the scenes."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Well-structured in episodic chapters that track Wilson's involvement from initial interest to full commitment to ultimate success. The five-part structure works effectively, though some transitions could be tightened. The final epilogue efficiently delivers the thematic payoff."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Charlie Wilson is magnificently drawn - a hard-drinking womanizer with serious political skills who finds purpose in an unlikely cause. His transformation from self-interested playboy to committed anti-Soviet crusader is organic and compelling. A complex, flawed character who remains likable despite his excesses."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "Exceptional supporting characters throughout. Gust Avrakotos is a perfectly conceived foil - the street-smart CIA operative to Wilson's polished politician. Joanne Herring is a fascinating power player using sexuality and religion as weapons. Even minor characters like Bonnie and Doc Long are distinctive and memorable."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "Sorkin's dialogue is exceptional - crackling with wit, character-specific, and manages to deliver complex political and historical context while remaining entertaining. The rapid-fire exchanges between Charlie and Gust are particular highlights, with distinct voices for each character."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Expertly balances political thriller, war drama, and dark comedy elements. The script delivers the satisfactions of each genre: backroom political dealing, foreign intrigue, battlefield action, while maintaining a consistent tone that allows for both humor and gravity."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While based on true events, the approach is distinctly fresh. Sorkin's voice is unmistakable, and the story hasn't been told in this form before. The script finds a way to make bureaucratic machinations and congressional appropriations compelling and dramatic."
