    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Flipping the Bonnie & Clyde narrative to focus on the lawmen who hunted them down is instantly compelling and fresh. The script examines heroism from a different angle and explores the cost of violence through those tasked with ending it rather than those committing it."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script follows a clear pursuit structure with escalating stakes and effective use of parallel narratives. The pursuit creates natural momentum, with effective setups and payoffs culminating in the inevitable, historically accurate climax."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Frank Hamer is a richly drawn protagonist with clear motivation, personal demons, and an arc that balances his methodical expertise with his moral burden. His backstory about wanting to be a preacher but becoming a killer instead provides profound depth."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Manny Gault serves as an excellent foil to Frank, bringing humor, moral questioning, and humanity. Secondary characters like Ted Hinton and the Barrow/Parker families are distinct and dimensioned rather than mere plot devices."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Dialogue is sharp, character-specific, and loaded with subtext. Characters have distinct voices, from Frank's terse directness to Manny's philosophical musings. Scenes like Frank's conversation with Old Man Barrow showcase excellent subtext."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Successfully blends crime drama, western elements, and buddy dynamics. The manhunt has the requisite tension, the character moments land emotionally, and it builds to a satisfying though morally complex climax."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Takes a well-known historical event and presents it from a unique angle, avoiding romanticizing the criminals while giving depth to the lawmen. The script examines the moral weight of violence rather than glorifying it."
