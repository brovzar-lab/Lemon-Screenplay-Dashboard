    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "A compelling historical drama focused on the less-known Boleyn sister provides fresh perspective on a famous historical period. The sibling rivalry within the context of Henry VIII's court creates natural dramatic tension with clear stakes."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script follows a clear chronological structure with effective rising action as Anne replaces Mary in the King's affections. The pacing effectively tracks the sisters' reversal of fortunes, though some middle sections feel episodic rather than building."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Mary is sympathetically drawn with a clear character arc from naive pawn to self-determined woman. She demonstrates agency in her final choice to leave court and choose love over ambition, though she remains somewhat reactive through the middle sections."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Anne is vividly drawn as complex and ambitious. Henry VIII, George Boleyn, Sir Thomas, the Duke of Norfolk, and William Stafford all have distinct personalities and motivations. The screenplay effectively portrays the scheming family members, creating a rich ensemble."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Period-appropriate without being stilted, with characters displaying distinct voices. Anne's witty, bold speech contrasts with Mary's more heartfelt and honest dialogue. Exchanges effectively reveal power dynamics and subtext, though occasionally exchanges become too on-the-nose."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script delivers the expected pleasures of a Tudor-era drama with political machinations, court intrigue, and romantic complications. It effectively portrays the era's patriarchal constraints while maintaining emotional intimacy amidst grand historical events."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While based on well-trodden historical material, the script offers a fresh angle by focusing on the relationship between the sisters and Mary's perspective rather than the more commonly portrayed Anne. The personal, intimate approach to grand historical events gives it distinction."
