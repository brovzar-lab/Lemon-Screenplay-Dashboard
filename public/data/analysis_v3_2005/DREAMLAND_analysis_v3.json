      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script offers an unflinching look at Timothy McVeigh's journey from Gulf War veteran to domestic terrorist, exploring his psyche and the real events that led to the Oklahoma City bombing. It's a compelling, challenging premise with clear audience interest in understanding the mind behind America's deadliest domestic terror attack prior to 9/11."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script effectively traces McVeigh's descent into extremism through well-connected sequences - from his childhood nuclear fantasies to Gulf War experiences to radicalization after Waco. While some transitions feel abrupt (particularly the time jumps), the screenplay maintains a clear trajectory toward its inevitable conclusion."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Tim McVeigh is portrayed with remarkable complexity - neither purely villain nor hero, but a disturbed individual whose military experiences, paranoia, and sense of betrayal drive him toward catastrophic violence. His transformation from idealistic soldier to domestic terrorist is thoroughly developed, with clear motivations and psychological underpinnings."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The supporting characters - especially Terry Nichols, Mike Fortier, and Jennifer McVeigh - have distinct personalities and roles in Tim's journey. Terry represents the more cautious extremist, Mike the follower seeking excitement, and Jennifer the innocent loved one. Secondary characters like Hermann, the McKnight brothers, and the Consultant create a believable world of extremism."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Dialogue effectively differentiates characters and reveals their worldviews without excessive exposition. Tim's conversations with Terry about government overreach, Mike's drug-induced ramblings, and the cold calculations of the bomb-planning scenes all ring true to character and situation."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "As a biographical drama about radicalization, the script succeeds in depicting the internal and external factors that transform an ordinary person into a terrorist. The paranoid atmosphere, incremental steps toward violence, and tension-building as the bombing approaches are all handled with skill and restraint."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While based on real events, the script offers a fresh, humanizing (though not sympathetic) perspective on McVeigh that avoids both demonization and glorification. The childhood nuclear fantasy framing device, Gulf War scenes, and paranoid conspiracy elements give the script a distinctive voice in tackling difficult subject matter."
