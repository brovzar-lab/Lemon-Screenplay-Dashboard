    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Strong, emotionally resonant hook combining crime and family drama - a father using his criminal skills for a meaningful purpose (getting out to be with his dying son). The ticking clock of the son's terminal illness adds urgency and stakes."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Clear three-act structure with well-defined plot points. The story builds momentum through Ray fulfilling Will's wishes while planning/executing the heist. Some expositional sections in the first act slow the momentum slightly."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Ray Cutter is a compelling, flawed character with a clear goal (reconnect with his dying son) and a well-defined arc from self-interested criminal to self-sacrificing father. His transformation feels earned through his interactions with Will."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Will and Joseph are well-developed with distinct personalities and contributions to the story. Secondary characters like Carl, Kim, and Keating are distinct and serve clear functions, though some (like Paisley) could have more dimension."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Dialogue generally feels natural and character-specific. Good use of subtext in father-son conversations. Some exposition is handled a bit directly, but overall the dialogue flows well and effectively communicates character."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Delivers on heist genre expectations with meticulous planning, execution, and a clever twist. The emotional family drama elements are integrated well with the crime plot, giving the story more weight than a standard heist film."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While utilizing familiar elements from heist films and father-son dramas, the script combines them in a fresh way. The art forgery angle is less explored than other criminal specialties, and the dying son motivation elevates it beyond standard genre fare."
