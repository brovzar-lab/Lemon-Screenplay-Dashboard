    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The script combines a famous historical tragedy with a compelling investigator in Nobel laureate Feynman. The stakes are exceptionally clear: truth about a national tragedy versus powerful institutional forces seeking to control the narrative. The concept is inherently dramatic and instantly compelling."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The narrative maintains strong forward momentum through the investigation, with effective setups and payoffs. The structure builds toward the climactic television interview where Feynman bypasses bureaucratic obstruction. The personal redemption arc parallels the main investigation effectively."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Feynman is brilliantly rendered - complex, flawed, brilliant, and dying. His quest is clear (discover the truth), his stakes personal (redemption for past moral failures), and his transformation earned through his growing understanding of responsibility. His terminal illness adds urgency and poignancy."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Excellent supporting characters with distinct voices and motivations: Kutyna as the principled military man, Rogers as the establishment figure, Boisjoly as the guilt-ridden engineer, and Gweneth as Feynman's emotional anchor. Each character serves both plot function and thematic purpose."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Distinctive character voices throughout, particularly Feynman's Brooklyn-tinged scientific explanations that make complex ideas accessible. Characters reveal themselves through subtext rather than exposition. Technical discussions remain engaging and comprehensible to laypeople."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Expertly delivers on the investigative thriller genre. The script builds tension through revelations, obstructions, and personal stakes. The investigation feels authentic, with Feynman's methods mirroring real scientific inquiry. The script avoids typical biopic tropes while delivering emotional impact."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While using familiar investigative story beats, the script brings originality through its protagonist's unique scientific perspective and methods. The ice water demonstration scene exemplifies how scientific thinking is cinematically presented. The subject matter itself remains relatively unexplored in mainstream film."
