    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Highly original premise that marries absurdity with genuine pathos - a socially awkward man who believes his sex doll is real and a community that decides to go along with it for his sake. The concept is both unique and intriguing, with clear opportunities for both comedy and emotional depth."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The script maintains a clear progression of Lars' journey from isolation through his relationship with Bianca to eventual reintegration with real human connections. While some middle sequences feel repetitive with the 'Bianca attends community events' pattern, the emotional arc remains clear."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Lars is exceptionally well-drawn - his awkwardness, trauma, and genuine goodness all shine through. His fear of human touch and inability to connect are rendered with psychological depth, making his gradual growth believable and affecting. His arc from isolation to connection is thorough and earned."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Strong ensemble of distinct characters including Gus (concerned brother), Karin (compassionate sister-in-law), Dr. Dagmar (insightful therapist), and townspeople like Mrs. Gruner. Each character has a specific perspective on Lars' situation, creating a textured community response."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Dialogue effectively balances humor with emotional authenticity. Characters speak distinctively - Lars' stilted social awkwardness contrasts with Gus's frustrated directness and Dagmar's careful therapeutic language. Some exposition is handled through dialogue but generally feels organic to the characters."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "As a character-driven dramedy, the script delivers both the emotional journey promised and the humorous elements of its absurd premise. The story balances laugh-out-loud moments with genuine pathos, though some comedic opportunities feel underexplored."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The premise is startlingly original - a man's delusion being treated as real by an entire community as a form of therapy. The script takes what could be purely comedic (a man with a sex doll) and transforms it into a sensitive exploration of trauma, connection, and community care."
