    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script tackles the under-explored subject of dyslexia from a child's perspective with a clear hook: a struggling student finds validation through a teacher who recognizes her unique abilities. The title (from the Einstein quote about judging fish by tree-climbing ability) perfectly encapsulates the theme."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The narrative moves steadily with clear act breaks - Ally meeting Mr. Daniels, discovery of dyslexia, overcoming obstacles to succeed. The parallel narratives of academic struggles and social dynamics weave together effectively, though there are some minor pacing issues in the second act."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Ally is well-drawn with clear external wants (fitting in, not getting in trouble) and internal needs (self-acceptance, understanding her own mind). Her active attempts to hide her disability drive much of the conflict, and her transformation from shame to confidence feels earned through the events of the story."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Strong supporting characters with distinct personalities and arcs - Albert with his scientific mind and implacable demeanor, Keisha's baking and directness, Travis's parallel struggles, and Mr. Daniels with his own transition from hockey enforcer to compassionate teacher. Even antagonists like Shay have understandable motivations."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Characters have distinct voices, particularly Albert's scientific declarations, Keisha's directness, and Ally's internal observations. The dialogue effectively conveys both emotional subtext and character relationships, with minimal on-the-nose exposition."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "As a coming-of-age/inspirational drama, the script delivers the expected beats - alienation, finding one's tribe, mentor relationship, and triumphant conclusion. The dyslexia aspect adds fresh perspective to familiar territory, though some emotional beats could be heightened further."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While the inspirational-teacher genre is well-established, the specific focus on dyslexia and the distinctive approach to showing Ally's perceptual experience offers fresh perspective. The script avoids many of the genre's clichés through its authentic characterizations and specific details about learning differences."
