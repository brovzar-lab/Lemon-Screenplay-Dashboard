    "author": "Gregory Navarro",
    "logline": "When British journalist Sandy Fawkes unwittingly spends a week with charismatic mass murderer Paul John Knowles during his 1974 killing spree, she must confront the horror of having been intimately deceived by a monster.",

    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Based on a true story with an irresistible hook: a female journalist unwittingly spending a week with an active serial killer. The script offers a fresh perspective on the true crime genre by focusing on the survivor's experience rather than glorifying the killer."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The narrative skillfully interweaves present timeline with flashbacks, creating tension and dread even when we know the outcome. The structure effectively builds the relationship between Sandy and Knowles while revealing his crimes, culminating in his capture and death."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Sandy Fawkes is a complex, flawed protagonist with clear wants (professional success, human connection) and needs (validation, understanding). Her journey from unwitting companion to horrified witness provides a compelling arc, though her agency is somewhat limited in the second half."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Knowles is a mesmerizing antagonist with depth beyond mere monster. Supporting characters like Osborne, Angel, Yavitz, and Jim MacKenzie all have distinct personalities, motivations, and voices that enhance the story rather than serving as mere plot devices."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Exceptional dialogue throughout. Characters have distinct voices - Sandy's British cynicism, Knowles' eerie philosophical musings, the regional cadences of Georgia law enforcement. Subtext abounds, especially in Knowles and Sandy's exchanges. The tape recordings add chilling layers."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Expertly delivers on crime thriller expectations with graphic but purposeful violence, mounting tension, and investigation elements. The script balances procedural aspects with psychological horror, creating genuine suspense despite knowing the outcome."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Though based on a true story, the script brings fresh perspective to the serial killer genre by focusing on Sandy's experience and avoiding glorification of violence. The period setting, structural choices, and literary quality elevate it above standard true crime fare."
