    "title": "The Man In The Yard",
    "author": "Sam Stefanak",
    "logline": "When a sinister stranger appears in their yard, a grieving mother with a broken body must protect her children from an otherworldly entity that feeds on her guilt and despair.",

    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "A simple yet immediately gripping premise - a stranger inexplicably sitting in the yard who becomes increasingly threatening. The contained setting and the invasion of safe domestic space creates immediate tension. The supernatural elements are woven organically into a family drama about grief and guilt."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Strong escalation from creepy stranger to full supernatural threat. Clear progression as the family first tries to understand the threat, then escape it, then finally confront it. The script effectively builds tension with failed attempts to signal for help, steadily removing options until the final confrontation."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Ramona is deeply drawn, struggling with guilt over her husband's death and her own survival. Her character arc from depressed, overwhelmed mother to fierce protector is compelling. Her physical limitations (casts on arm and leg) add tangible obstacles while serving as external manifestations of her internal wounds."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Ben and Annie are well-developed with distinct personalities. Ben's anger and resentment toward his mother evolves naturally into protection. Annie's childlike perspective adds vulnerability. The Man In The Yard is genuinely unsettling with his false Southern charm masking his supernatural malevolence."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Character voices are distinct. The Man's folksy, menacing Southern drawl contrasts with Ben's contemporary teen speech. Annie speaks authentically as a child. Exposition is handled naturally through character interactions rather than info dumps. Some dialogue occasionally feels a bit on-the-nose."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Expertly builds dread from the opening scenes. Uses supernatural horror elements to enhance the psychological terror rather than relying on gore. Creates genuine fear through both the physical threat and the emotional manipulation of the antagonist. The attic sequence is a masterclass in sustained tension."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While utilizing familiar horror tropes (isolated house, supernatural threat), the script feels fresh in its execution. The Man In The Yard is a distinctive antagonist. The connection between the external threat and the mother's internal guilt adds psychological depth beyond standard horror fare. Some story beats feel recognizable from other home invasion thrillers."
