    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The concept of exploring an invisible man's descent into darkness through bodybuilding is instantly compelling. The script tackles race, toxic masculinity, and mental illness through a uniquely disturbing lens that feels both timely and cinematically potent."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script follows a clear downward spiral structure with effective escalation. Killian's deterioration occurs in well-orchestrated phases, from failed competition to failed romance to increasingly violent episodes, building to a climactic decision point."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Killian Maddox is an unforgettable character with clear wants (recognition, visibility, perfection) and needs (connection, acceptance). His isolation and spiral are rendered with complexity, making him simultaneously terrifying and deeply human."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters like Jessie, the grandfather, the working girl, and the counselor all feel like real people with distinct voices. While they primarily serve Killian's journey, they avoid stereotypes and create a believable world around him."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The dialogue captures each character's voice authentically. Killian's stilted, formal speech perfectly reflects his mental state, while interactions like the Applebee's date masterfully build tension through realistic conversation."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "As a psychological thriller examining a potential mass shooter's mindset, the script excels. It creates unsettling tension, dread, and moments of shocking violence without feeling exploitative, while providing social commentary on America's relationship with violence."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The script feels utterly distinct and confidently executed. The combination of bodybuilding culture, racial alienation, and mental illness creates a unique character study unlike anything in recent cinema, with a bold visual and thematic vision."
