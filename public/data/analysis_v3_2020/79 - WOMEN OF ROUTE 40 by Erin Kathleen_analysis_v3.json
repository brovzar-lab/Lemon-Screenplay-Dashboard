    "title": "The Women of Route 40",
    "author": "Erin Kathleen",
    "logline": "A restaurant manager with a hidden past teams up with a detective to hunt the serial killer targeting sex workers along Route 40 — the same stretch of road where her own history threatens to resurface.",

    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The concept merges procedural thriller with profound personal stakes. A woman with a hidden past as a sex worker hunting the killer targeting women like her former self creates immediate tension and layered emotional investment. The 1980s setting adds period texture to the familiar serial killer investigation."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Well-structured investigation with escalating tension and parallel character journeys. The script effectively balances the murder investigation with Pam's personal journey and her relationship with her daughter. A few transitional moments feel abrupt, but the overall architecture serves both plot and character development well."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Pam is exceptionally well-drawn - a complex woman caught between her past and present identities. Her struggle to maintain respectability while being drawn back to a world she escaped creates consistent internal conflict. Her arc from shame to acceptance is earned through action, and her active role in the investigation demonstrates agency throughout."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Miles, Nikki, Paulie, and the various sex workers all feel like complete individuals with their own perspectives and motivations. Miles' damaged history and Nikki's teenage search for identity particularly stand out. Even smaller roles like the cowboy trucker and Agent Pendergast have distinctive personalities."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Dialogue effectively establishes character voices and regional flavor. Pam and Miles have particularly distinctive speech patterns that reveal their backgrounds and personalities. Exposition is generally well-handled, though there are occasional on-the-nose moments, especially in establishing the serial killer investigation."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script delivers on the serial killer procedural expectations with escalating danger, red herrings, and a tense climax. The genre is elevated by the personal connection between hunter and potential victims, creating higher emotional stakes than typical procedurals. The final confrontation and aftermath provide satisfying resolution to both plot and character arcs."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While working within familiar serial killer thriller territory, the script finds fresh angles through its exploration of class, stigma, and the unique perspective of its protagonist. The 1980s Delaware setting and the focus on society's perception of sex workers adds specificity and thematic weight that distinguishes it from similar stories."
