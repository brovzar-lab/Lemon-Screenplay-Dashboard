    "dimension_scores": {
      "concept": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The concept of an unlikely friendship between an undocumented immigrant and a transgender teen is fresh and timely, though requires some explanation beyond a one-sentence hook. The dual-protagonist approach explores similar themes of identity through different lenses, creating a marketable premise with clear audience appeal."
      },
      "structure": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The script has a functional structure with clear progression, though there are some saggy sections, particularly in the middle. The parallel storylines sometimes feel disconnected, and the resolution happens quickly without giving all emotional beats enough space to land."
      },
      "protagonist": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Wei-Ling and Rachael are both compelling protagonists with clear goals and obstacles. Wei-Ling wants to reconnect with her daughter while avoiding deportation, and Rachael wants to pursue her fashion dreams while gaining her mother's acceptance. Both show agency in driving their stories forward and have well-earned transformations."
      },
      "supporting_cast": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Strong supporting characters with distinct personalities, particularly Sharon, Juliette, Malek, and Li Jun. Each has their own arc and contributes meaningfully to the protagonists' journeys. Minor characters like Annie and Father Wong are somewhat flatter but serve their functions well."
      },
      "dialogue": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Characters have distinct voices that reflect their backgrounds and personalities. Wei-Ling's accented English creates authentic moments both humorous and poignant. Exposition is generally well-handled through dialogue, though occasionally on-the-nose, particularly in confrontation scenes."
      },
      "genre_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "As a drama with comic elements, the script effectively delivers emotional impact and character growth. The film balances levity with serious themes, though some of the more dramatic moments (like Rachael's accident) could be better integrated into the overall tone. The mother-daughter reconciliation scenes deliver the expected emotional payoff."
      },
      "originality": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The script presents a fresh take on both immigration and transgender stories by pairing them together in a way that highlights their parallels without feeling forced. Wei-Ling's perspective as an older Asian immigrant provides a distinctive lens rarely seen in mainstream American films, and the script avoids many expected clichés of both storylines."
