# CLAUDE.md — Lemon Screenplay Dashboard

## Where Were We (WWW)
<!-- Single source of truth for session continuity. OVERWRITE this whole section on "save" / "wrap up" / end of session — it reflects CURRENT state, not a log. On "www" / "where were we", read this back and summarize. -->

**Last session:** 2026-07-07

**Done (landed on `main` @ `2e5fe7e`, deployed to prod + VPS daemon):**
- Pipeline truth-fixes: verdict now computed in code (not the model's honor system); fixed the critical-failure-penalty bug; boundary re-runs (median-of-3) for scores within 0.5 of a verdict line.
- Security: LLM proxy locked (Firebase ID token for browsers, `PROXY_SERVICE_KEY` header for the daemon — verified 401/403/200 live); share links expire after 30 days (client + firestore.rules).
- Genre brain: Story Grid genre-aware reading — `execution/story_grid.json` + `story_grid.py`, all 11 genres, comedy-pairing rule, injected into readers. Validated on real scripts, deployed to daemon.
- VPS parser rescued into git (`execution/parse_screenplay_pdf_v2.py`); reskin-branch build error fixed.

**In progress:** Team tool (Google sign-in + roles). **The code was LOST** — it lived in an ephemeral `/private/tmp` worktree that was wiped over a multi-day gap, and was never committed (`team-tool` branch had 0 commits, now deleted). **No design decisions lost — must rebuild.** Settled design: Google sign-in restricted to **@lemonfilms.com**; roles **admin** (upload/delete/manage) + **reader** (read/note/share); `ADMIN_EMAILS = ['billy@lemonfilms.com']` bootstraps admins; login gate wraps `/` and `/settings` but leaves `/share/:token` public; firestore.rules `isLemon()` + `isAdmin()` with a self-promotion guard on `users/{uid}`; close the public-read hole on `uploaded_analyses` (Lemon-read-only). Files to (re)create: `src/lib/firebase.ts` (swap anonymous→Google), `src/stores/authStore.ts`, `src/components/auth/{AuthGate,LoginScreen}.tsx`, `firestore.rules`, `src/test/setup.ts` mock. Deploy needs a Firebase console step (enable Google provider, disable anonymous, add authorized domain) — flag for Billy. **Work in a committed worktree from the start.**

**Next up (priority order):**
1. Rebuild the team tool (above), committing after each working piece.
2. Email ingest — a drop-address the daemon watches; PDF attachments → ingest queue.
3. Shared notes/favorites → Firestore (currently localStorage-only; the "we all have the info" gap).
4. C2 security: rotate the still-bundled Google/TMDB keys + proxy poster generation server-side.

**Open questions / blockers:**
- C2 key rotation needs Billy in the Google Cloud / TMDB consoles (Claude can't).
- Enabling Google auth needs the Firebase console toggle before the team-tool cutover works.
- Detector may slightly under-call comedy on dramedies (e.g. The Bucket List → Love/Redemption) — a dial to watch once it runs on more of the real slate.
- Backfill (~1,000 scripts, ~$300) is unblocked (genre brain replaced the anchor-weekend gate) but not yet run.

## Project
Internal screenplay-analysis dashboard for Lemon Studios. Ingests AI-generated coverage JSONs (V9 format), stores them in Firestore, and provides filtering, scoring, comparison, analytics charts, PDF export, and shareable links. Used to triage 500+ screenplays for producer review and partner sharing.

**Analysis engine**: V9 Archaeology Engine — 5 parallel readers (Structure, Character, Craft, Concept, Emotion) + a synthesis roundtable. All prior engines (V3–V8) removed. Every LLM call routes server-side through the `llmProxy` Cloud Function; API keys never touch the browser.

## Stack
- React 19 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite 7
- Tailwind CSS 4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin — no PostCSS config needed)
- Zustand 5 (client state) + TanStack React Query 5 (server state)
- React Router 7 (3 routes), Recharts 3, @react-pdf/renderer, pdfjs-dist, papaparse, @dnd-kit, TanStack React Virtual 3, html2pdf.js, jszip, date-fns
- Firebase 12 (Firestore + Storage + anonymous Auth + Hosting + Cloud Functions, Node 22)
- Vitest 4 + Testing Library (unit) + Playwright (e2e)

## Commands
| Task | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Install | `npm install` | Functions deps auto-install on first `dev:full` |
| Dev (app only) | `npm run dev` | Vite on **port 3000** (fixed in vite.config.ts). Do NOT change — anonymous Firebase login + localStorage are tied to it |
| Dev (app + AI) | `npm run dev:full` | Runs Vite **and** the Firebase Functions emulator so `llmProxy` AI features work locally (`bash dev-full.sh`) |
| Build | `npm run build` | `tsc -b` typecheck + Vite build. `prebuild` clears `dist/assets` |
| Unit tests | `npm run test:run` | Vitest single run. Uses `TMPDIR=./.tmp` + `src/test/fix-eperm.cjs` (macOS EPERM workaround) |
| Test + coverage | `npm run test:coverage` | |
| E2E | `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright; runs against `npm run preview` (port 4173), not the dev server |
| E2E (visible) | `npm run test:e2e:headed` | |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | `eslint .` (flat config) |
| Format | `npm run format` | Prettier on `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}` |
| Deploy hosting | `npm run deploy` | Build then `firebase deploy --only hosting` |
| Deploy functions | `npm run deploy:functions` | `cd functions && npm run build` then deploys functions (run from repo root) |

## Routes (src/main.tsx)
```
/                → App           (main dashboard)

### lib/ (core, non-UI)
- `firebase.ts` — app init, Firestore/Storage/anonymous-Auth handles. **Firebase web config is hardcoded here** (apiKey/projectId literals — public web values), not from env.
- `api.ts`, `normalize.ts` (+ `normalizers/`), `calculations.ts` — data fetch, V9-JSON normalization, score math
- `analysisStore.ts` — data migration (static JSON → Firestore); reads Firestore post-migration. Lives in `lib/`, NOT `stores/`
- `multiPassAnalysis.ts` → `promptClient.v9.ts` → `proxyClient.ts` — client side of the V9 pipeline; 5 readers run via `Promise.allSettled()` then synthesis, all through the proxy
- `shareService.ts`, `pdfParser.ts`, `tmdbService.ts`, `percentileRanking.ts`, `badFormatStore.ts`, `feedbackStore.ts`

## Data Flow
```
Firestore → useScreenplays (React Query, 30min stale) + useLiveScreenplaySync (live Firestore listener)
  → useFilteredScreenplays (reads filterStore + sortStore)
    → Components
```
`useLiveScreenplaySync` (in `hooks/useScreenplays.ts`) makes daemon-written analyses appear live, no refresh.

## Cloud Functions (functions/ — separate npm package, Node 22)
- `src/llmProxy.ts` — exported. Server-side LLM proxy (Anthropic/Google); the API key lives here only. Reached at `/api/llm` in prod (firebase.json rewrite), emulator in dev.
- `src/onScreenplayUploaded.ts` — exported. Storage trigger; kicks the VPS daemon on new PDF upload.
- `src/budgetCounter.ts`, `src/ingestQueue.ts` — supporting logic, NOT exported from `index.ts`.
- Build: `cd functions && npm run build`. Deploy: `npm run deploy:functions` from repo root.

## Environment (.env, gitignored — see .env.example)
```
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET   # Storage bucket name
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY         # dev-only; prod uses the llmProxy Cloud Function
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY            # Gemini — poster generation + DevExec chat (optional, degrades gracefully)
```
VPS daemon vars (set in the systemd unit, NOT this file): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `TMDB_API_KEY`.

## Conventions
- TypeScript strict — no `any`. Data types live in `types/screenplay.ts` only (`screenplay-v6.ts` deleted).
- Import via `@/` alias, not relative paths. Aliases: `@` → `src/`, `@data` → `../.tmp`.
- Zustand = client state, React Query = server state. Check the relevant store before adding local state.
- Tailwind only — no inline styles or CSS modules.
- Tests sit next to source (`filterStore.test.ts` beside `filterStore.ts`).
- PascalCase components, camelCase utilities.

## Before Changes
1. `npm run build` — does TypeScript compile?
2. `npm run test:run` — do tests pass?
3. Touching data shapes? Read `types/screenplay.ts` (single source of truth).

## Gotchas
- **Dev port is 3000, load-bearing.** Hardcoded in `vite.config.ts`. Anonymous Firebase login and localStorage data are tied to `localhost:3000` — changing the port silently loses that state. Kill a stale server before assuming a fix didn't work.
- **AI features need the emulator locally.** Plain `npm run dev` has no `llmProxy`; use `npm run dev:full` to run Vite + Functions emulator together.
- **Firebase web config is hardcoded** in `src/lib/firebase.ts` (apiKey/projectId literals — public web-app values). The `VITE_` env vars only cover the storage bucket and AI keys.
- **macOS EPERM workaround.** Test scripts set `TMPDIR=./.tmp` and preload `src/test/fix-eperm.cjs`. The Vite build uses `emptyOutDir: false` + `copyPublicDir: false` and a `skip-ds-store` plugin to avoid EPERM on `.DS_Store`.
- **E2E runs against `preview` (4173)**, not the dev server.
- **`analysisStore` is in `lib/`, not `stores/`**, and is not re-exported from `stores/index.ts`.
- **Store/hook barrels are partial.** `stores/index.ts` and `hooks/index.ts` only re-export a subset; many stores/hooks are imported by direct path. Add a new store's export to `stores/index.ts` if you want it in the barrel, but don't assume everything is there.
- **App Check is intentionally off** (a prior provider mismatch caused 400s — see comment in `firebase.ts`). Auth is anonymous: reads public, writes require the auth token (see `firestore.rules`).

## Do Not
- Modify anything in `agent/` (read-only Antigravity/Gemini kit).
- Change the dev port from 3000.
- Use `any`, or add inline styles / CSS modules.
- Skip the TypeScript build check before committing.

## Deployment
Firebase project `lemon-screenplay-dashboard` (`.firebaserc`). Hosting via `npm run deploy` (serves `dist/`). Cloud Functions deploy separately via `npm run deploy:functions`. A VPS daemon (`daemon.py` → `execution/ingest_v9.py`) runs server-side V9 analysis and writes results to Firestore.
